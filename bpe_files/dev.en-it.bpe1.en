L@@ ast year I sh@@ ow@@ ed these two s@@ li@@ de@@ s so that de@@ mon@@ str@@ ate that the ar@@ c@@ t@@ ic ice ca@@ p , which for most of the last three million years has been the si@@ z@@ e of the l@@ ow@@ er 4@@ 8 st@@ ates , has sh@@ r@@ un@@ k by 4@@ 0 percent .
But this underst@@ ates the ser@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of this partic@@ ular problem because it doesn &apos;t show the th@@ ick@@ ness of the ice .
The ar@@ c@@ t@@ ic ice ca@@ p is , in a sen@@ se , the be@@ ating hear@@ t of the glob@@ al clim@@ ate system .
It ex@@ p@@ ands in w@@ int@@ er and contr@@ act@@ s in sum@@ m@@ er .
The next s@@ li@@ de I show you will be a rap@@ id f@@ ast@@ -@@ for@@ w@@ ard of what &apos;s happen@@ ed over the last 2@@ 5 years .
The per@@ man@@ ent ice is mar@@ ked in red .
A@@ s you see , it ex@@ p@@ ands to the d@@ ar@@ k bl@@ ue --
that &apos;s the an@@ nu@@ al ice in w@@ int@@ er , and it contr@@ act@@ s in sum@@ m@@ er .
The so@@ -@@ called per@@ man@@ ent ice , f@@ ive years old or ol@@ der , you can see is al@@ most like bl@@ ood , sp@@ ill@@ ing out of the body here .
In 2@@ 5 years it &apos;s g@@ one from this , to this .
This is a problem because the w@@ ar@@ m@@ ing he@@ at@@ s up the fr@@ o@@ z@@ en gr@@ ound around the Ar@@ c@@ t@@ ic O@@ ce@@ an , where there is a m@@ ass@@ ive am@@ oun@@ t of fr@@ o@@ z@@ en car@@ b@@ on which , when it th@@ aw@@ s , is tur@@ ned into me@@ th@@ ane by mic@@ rob@@ es .
C@@ om@@ par@@ ed to the t@@ ot@@ al am@@ oun@@ t of glob@@ al w@@ ar@@ m@@ ing p@@ oll@@ ution in the at@@ mos@@ p@@ here , that am@@ oun@@ t could d@@ ou@@ ble if we cr@@ os@@ s this ti@@ p@@ p@@ ing point .
Al@@ read@@ y in some sh@@ all@@ ow la@@ kes in Al@@ as@@ k@@ a , me@@ th@@ ane is act@@ iv@@ ely bu@@ b@@ bl@@ ing up out of the water .
P@@ r@@ of@@ ess@@ or K@@ at@@ ey W@@ al@@ ter from the Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity of Al@@ as@@ k@@ a went out with another te@@ am to another sh@@ all@@ ow la@@ ke last w@@ int@@ er .
V@@ ide@@ o : Wh@@ o@@ a ! A@@ l G@@ ore : S@@ he &apos;s o@@ k@@ ay . The question is wh@@ ether we will be .
And one reas@@ on is , this en@@ or@@ m@@ ous he@@ at sin@@ k he@@ at@@ s up G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ and from the nor@@ th .
This is an an@@ nu@@ al m@@ el@@ t@@ ing riv@@ er .
But the vol@@ um@@ es are much l@@ arg@@ er than ever .
This is the K@@ ang@@ er@@ l@@ us@@ su@@ a@@ q R@@ iv@@ er in s@@ ou@@ th@@ w@@ est G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ and .
If you want to know how se@@ a l@@ ev@@ el ris@@ es from l@@ and@@ -@@ bas@@ e ice m@@ el@@ t@@ ing this is where it re@@ ach@@ es the se@@ a .
Th@@ ese fl@@ ows are incre@@ as@@ ing very rap@@ id@@ ly .
A@@ t the other end of the plan@@ et , An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ t@@ ica the l@@ arg@@ est m@@ ass of ice on the plan@@ et .
L@@ ast mon@@ th scient@@ ists re@@ port@@ ed the ent@@ ire contin@@ ent is now in ne@@ g@@ ative ice b@@ al@@ ance . And w@@ est An@@ t@@ ar@@ c@@ t@@ ica cr@@ op@@ p@@ ed up on to@@ p some under@@ -@@ se@@ a is@@ l@@ ands , is partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly rap@@ id in its m@@ el@@ t@@ ing .
That &apos;s equ@@ al to 20 fe@@ et of se@@ a l@@ ev@@ el , as is G@@ re@@ en@@ l@@ and .
In the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ as , the th@@ ir@@ d l@@ arg@@ est m@@ ass of ice : at the to@@ p you see new la@@ kes , which a few years ago were gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers .
4@@ 0 percent of all the people in the world get h@@ al@@ f of their dr@@ in@@ king water from that m@@ el@@ t@@ ing fl@@ ow .
In the An@@ de@@ s , this gl@@ ac@@ i@@ er is the s@@ our@@ ce of dr@@ in@@ king water for this c@@ ity .
The fl@@ ows have incre@@ as@@ ed .
But when they go away , so does much of the dr@@ in@@ king water .
In C@@ al@@ i@@ for@@ n@@ ia there has been a 4@@ 0 percent de@@ cl@@ ine in the S@@ i@@ erra s@@ now@@ p@@ ack .
This is h@@ itt@@ ing the res@@ er@@ v@@ o@@ ir@@ s .
And the pre@@ dic@@ t@@ ions , as you &apos;ve re@@ ad , are ser@@ i@@ ous .
This dr@@ ying around the world has le@@ ad to a dr@@ am@@ at@@ ic incre@@ ase in fi@@ res .
And the dis@@ ast@@ ers around the world have been incre@@ as@@ ing at an ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary and un@@ pre@@ c@@ ed@@ ent@@ ed r@@ ate .
F@@ our tim@@ es as many in the last 30 years as in the pre@@ vi@@ ous 7@@ 5 .
This is a complet@@ ely un@@ su@@ st@@ ain@@ able pat@@ ter@@ n .
If you look at in the cont@@ ex@@ t of h@@ ist@@ ory you can see what this is doing .
In the last f@@ ive years we &apos;ve ad@@ ded 7@@ 0 million t@@ ons of C@@ O@@ 2 every 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s -- 2@@ 5 million t@@ ons every day to the oce@@ ans .
L@@ ook car@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly at the ar@@ ea of the e@@ ast@@ er@@ n P@@ ac@@ if@@ ic , from the Amer@@ ic@@ as , ex@@ t@@ end@@ ing w@@ est@@ w@@ ard , and on e@@ i@@ ther side of the In@@ di@@ an sub@@ contin@@ ent , where there is a r@@ ad@@ ical de@@ pl@@ et@@ ion of o@@ x@@ y@@ g@@ en in the oce@@ ans .
The b@@ ig@@ g@@ est sing@@ le c@@ ause of glob@@ al w@@ ar@@ m@@ ing , al@@ ong with de@@ for@@ est@@ ation , which is 20 percent of it , is the b@@ ur@@ ning of fos@@ s@@ il fu@@ el@@ s .
O@@ il is a problem , and co@@ al is the most ser@@ i@@ ous problem .
The Un@@ ited St@@ ates is one of the two l@@ arg@@ est em@@ it@@ ter@@ s , al@@ ong with Ch@@ ina .
And the prop@@ os@@ al has been to buil@@ d a lot more co@@ al pl@@ ant@@ s .
But we &apos;re beg@@ in@@ ning to see a se@@ a change .
H@@ ere are the ones that have been can@@ cell@@ ed in the last few years with some gre@@ en al@@ ter@@ nat@@ iv@@ es prop@@ os@@ ed .
H@@ ow@@ ever there is a polit@@ ical batt@@ le in our country .
And the co@@ al ind@@ ustr@@ ies and the o@@ il ind@@ ustr@@ ies sp@@ ent a qu@@ art@@ er of a bil@@ lion doll@@ ars in the last cal@@ end@@ ar year pr@@ om@@ ot@@ ing c@@ le@@ an co@@ al , which is an o@@ x@@ y@@ mor@@ on .
That im@@ age re@@ min@@ ded me of something .
Ar@@ ound Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as , in my h@@ ome in T@@ en@@ ness@@ ee , a bil@@ lion g@@ all@@ ons of co@@ al s@@ lu@@ d@@ ge was sp@@ ill@@ ed .
You prob@@ ably sa@@ w it on the ne@@ w@@ s .
This , all over the country , is the secon@@ d l@@ arg@@ est w@@ ast@@ e str@@ e@@ am in America .
This happen@@ ed around Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as .
O@@ ne of the co@@ al ind@@ us@@ try &apos;s ad@@ s around Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ m@@ as was this one .

L@@ ast year at TED I g@@ ave an in@@ tr@@ od@@ uc@@ tion to the L@@ H@@ C .
And I pr@@ om@@ is@@ ed to come back and give you an up@@ d@@ ate on how that ma@@ ch@@ ine wor@@ ked .
So this is it . And for those of you that w@@ er@@ en &apos;t there , the L@@ H@@ C is the l@@ arg@@ est scient@@ if@@ ic ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent ever att@@ em@@ p@@ ted -- 2@@ 7 k@@ il@@ om@@ et@@ ers in cir@@ c@@ um@@ fer@@ ence .
I@@ ts jo@@ b is to re@@ create the cond@@ it@@ ions that were pres@@ ent less than a bil@@ li@@ on@@ th of a secon@@ d after the univer@@ se beg@@ an , up to 6@@ 00 million tim@@ es a secon@@ d .
It &apos;s no@@ thing if not amb@@ it@@ i@@ ous .
This is the ma@@ ch@@ ine bel@@ ow G@@ en@@ eva .
We take the pic@@ tu@@ res of those min@@ i@@ -@@ B@@ i@@ g B@@ ang@@ s in@@ side det@@ ect@@ ors .
This is the one I work on . It &apos;s called the A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S det@@ ect@@ or -- 4@@ 4 met@@ ers w@@ ide , 2@@ 2 met@@ ers in di@@ am@@ et@@ er .
S@@ p@@ ect@@ ac@@ ular pic@@ ture here of A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S un@@ der con@@ str@@ uc@@ tion so you can see the sc@@ ale .
O@@ n the 1@@ 0@@ th of S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber last year we tur@@ ned the ma@@ ch@@ ine on for the first time .
And this pic@@ ture was ta@@ k@@ en by A@@ T@@ L@@ A@@ S .
It ca@@ used im@@ men@@ se c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ation in the contr@@ ol room .
It &apos;s a pic@@ ture of the first be@@ am partic@@ le going all the way around the L@@ H@@ C , col@@ li@@ ding with a pi@@ ece of the L@@ H@@ C del@@ i@@ ber@@ at@@ ely , and sh@@ ow@@ er@@ ing partic@@ les into the det@@ ect@@ or .
In other wor@@ ds , when we sa@@ w that pic@@ ture on S@@ ep@@ tem@@ ber 1@@ 0@@ th we k@@ new the ma@@ ch@@ ine wor@@ ked , which is a great tri@@ um@@ p@@ h .
I don &apos;t know wh@@ ether this got the b@@ ig@@ g@@ est ch@@ e@@ er , or this , when some@@ one went on@@ to Go@@ og@@ le and sa@@ w the fron@@ t p@@ age was like that .
It me@@ ans we made cult@@ ur@@ al imp@@ act as well as scient@@ if@@ ic imp@@ act .
Ab@@ out a we@@ e@@ k l@@ ater we had a problem with the ma@@ ch@@ ine , rel@@ ated actually to these b@@ its of w@@ ire here -- these g@@ old wi@@ res .
Th@@ ose wi@@ res car@@ r@@ y 1@@ 3 th@@ ous@@ and am@@ ps when the ma@@ ch@@ ine is working in f@@ ul@@ l power .
Now the eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers am@@ ong@@ st you will look at them and say , &quot; No they don &apos;t . They &apos;re sm@@ all wi@@ res . &quot;
They can do that because when they are very col@@ d they are what &apos;s called super@@ cond@@ uc@@ t@@ ing w@@ ire .
So at min@@ us 2@@ 7@@ 1 de@@ gre@@ es , col@@ der than the sp@@ ace between the st@@ ars , those wi@@ res can take that cur@@ r@@ ent .
In one of the jo@@ int@@ s between over 9@@ ,000 mag@@ n@@ ets in L@@ H@@ C , there was a man@@ u@@ f@@ act@@ ur@@ ing de@@ f@@ ect .
So the w@@ ire he@@ ated up s@@ lig@@ h@@ t@@ ly , and its 1@@ 3@@ ,000 am@@ ps su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly en@@ coun@@ ter@@ ed el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ical res@@ ist@@ ance .
This was the res@@ ult .
Now that &apos;s more im@@ press@@ ive when you consi@@ der those mag@@ n@@ ets we@@ ig@@ h over 20 t@@ ons , and they mov@@ ed about a f@@ oo@@ t .
So we dam@@ ag@@ ed about 50 of the mag@@ n@@ ets .
We had to take them out , which we did .
We re@@ cond@@ it@@ ion@@ ed them all , fi@@ x@@ ed them .
They &apos;re all on their way back under@@ gr@@ ound now .
B@@ y the end of M@@ ar@@ ch the L@@ H@@ C will be int@@ act again .
We will s@@ wit@@ ch it on , and we ex@@ p@@ ect to take data in J@@ un@@ e or J@@ u@@ ly , and contin@@ ue with our ques@@ t to find out what the buil@@ ding bl@@ oc@@ ks of the univer@@ se are .
Now of course , in a way those acci@@ d@@ ents re@@ ig@@ n@@ ite the de@@ b@@ ate about the val@@ ue of sci@@ ence and eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing at the ed@@ ge . It &apos;s e@@ as@@ y to re@@ fu@@ te .
I think that the fact that it &apos;s so diffic@@ ult , the fact that we &apos;re over@@ re@@ ach@@ ing , is the val@@ ue of things like the L@@ H@@ C .
I will le@@ ave the fin@@ al wor@@ d to an E@@ n@@ gli@@ s@@ h scient@@ ist , H@@ um@@ ph@@ re@@ y D@@ av@@ y , who , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , when de@@ f@@ end@@ ing his prot@@ e@@ ge &apos;s us@@ el@@ ess ex@@ per@@ im@@ ents -- his prot@@ e@@ ge was M@@ ich@@ a@@ el F@@ ar@@ ad@@ ay -- said this , &quot; N@@ o@@ thing is so d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous to the prog@@ res@@ s of the human min@@ d than to as@@ su@@ me that our vi@@ e@@ w@@ s of sci@@ ence are ultim@@ ate , that there are no my@@ st@@ er@@ ies in nat@@ ure , that our tri@@ um@@ ph@@ s are comp@@ le@@ te , and that there are no new wor@@ l@@ ds to con@@ qu@@ er . &quot;
Thank you .
I want to start out by as@@ king you to think back to when you were a k@@ id , pl@@ aying with bl@@ oc@@ ks .
A@@ s you fig@@ u@@ red out how to re@@ ach out and gr@@ as@@ p , pic@@ k them up and m@@ ove them around , you were actually lear@@ ning how to think and sol@@ ve probl@@ ems by underst@@ and@@ ing and man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating sp@@ at@@ ial rel@@ at@@ ion@@ shi@@ ps .
S@@ pat@@ ial reas@@ on@@ ing is de@@ ep@@ ly conn@@ ected to how we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer scient@@ ist in@@ spi@@ red by this ut@@ il@@ ity of our inter@@ act@@ ions with ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical ob@@ j@@ ects -- al@@ ong with my ad@@ vis@@ er P@@ att@@ ie , and my coll@@ abor@@ at@@ or J@@ e@@ ev@@ an K@@ al@@ an@@ i@@ th@@ i -- I started to w@@ on@@ der -- what if when we used a computer , in@@ ste@@ ad of hav@@ ing this one m@@ ou@@ se cur@@ s@@ or that was a like a dig@@ it@@ al f@@ ing@@ er@@ ti@@ p mov@@ ing around a fl@@ at des@@ k@@ to@@ p , what if we could re@@ ach in with b@@ ot@@ h h@@ ands and gr@@ as@@ p inform@@ ation ph@@ y@@ sic@@ ally ,
ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ing it the way we wanted ?
This question was so comp@@ ell@@ ing that we deci@@ ded to expl@@ ore the ans@@ w@@ er , by buil@@ ding S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les .
In a n@@ ut@@ sh@@ ell , a S@@ if@@ t@@ able is an inter@@ act@@ ive computer
the si@@ z@@ e of a c@@ oo@@ k@@ ie .
They &apos;re able to be mov@@ ed around by h@@ and , they can sen@@ se each other , they can sen@@ se their mot@@ ion , and they have a sc@@ re@@ en and a w@@ ir@@ el@@ ess ra@@ dio .
M@@ os@@ t import@@ ant@@ ly , they &apos;re ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical , so like the bl@@ oc@@ ks , you can m@@ ove them just by re@@ ach@@ ing out and gr@@ asp@@ ing .
And S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les are an example of a new ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of to@@ ol@@ s for man@@ i@@ p@@ ul@@ ating dig@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation .
And as these to@@ ol@@ s bec@@ ome more ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical , more aw@@ are of their mot@@ ion , aw@@ are of each other , and aw@@ are of the nu@@ ance of how we m@@ ove them , we can start to expl@@ ore some new and f@@ un inter@@ act@@ ion st@@ y@@ les .
So , I &apos;m going to start with some sim@@ ple exam@@ pl@@ es .
This S@@ if@@ t@@ able is con@@ fig@@ u@@ red to show video , and if I t@@ il@@ t it in one di@@ rec@@ tion , it &apos;ll r@@ ol@@ l the video this way ; if I t@@ il@@ t it the other way it r@@ oll@@ s it b@@ ack@@ w@@ ar@@ ds .
And these inter@@ act@@ ive por@@ tra@@ its are aw@@ are of each other .
So if I put them next to each other , they get interest@@ ed .
If they get sur@@ r@@ oun@@ ded , they not@@ ice that too ,
they might get a little fl@@ ust@@ er@@ ed .
And they can also sen@@ se their mot@@ ion and t@@ il@@ t .
O@@ ne of the interest@@ ing im@@ plic@@ ations on inter@@ act@@ ion , we started to real@@ ize , was that we could use every@@ day g@@ est@@ u@@ res on data , like p@@ our@@ ing a col@@ or the way we might p@@ our a li@@ qu@@ id .
So in this case , we &apos;ve got three S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les con@@ fig@@ u@@ red to be pa@@ int b@@ uc@@ k@@ ets and I can use them to p@@ our col@@ or into that centr@@ al one ,
where they get mi@@ x@@ ed .
If we over@@ sh@@ oo@@ t , we can p@@ our a little bit back .
There are also some ne@@ at possi@@ bil@@ ities for educ@@ ation , like lan@@ gu@@ age , mat@@ h and l@@ og@@ ic g@@ am@@ es where we want to give people the abil@@ ity to try things qu@@ ick@@ ly , and vi@@ e@@ w the res@@ ult@@ s im@@ me@@ di@@ at@@ ely .
So here I &apos;m --
This is a F@@ i@@ b@@ on@@ ac@@ ci se@@ qu@@ ence that I &apos;m ma@@ king with a sim@@ ple equ@@ ation prog@@ ra@@ m .
H@@ ere we have a wor@@ d g@@ ame that &apos;s kind of like a m@@ as@@ h@@ -@@ up between S@@ cr@@ ab@@ ble and B@@ ogg@@ le .
B@@ as@@ ically , in every r@@ ound you get a r@@ and@@ om@@ ly as@@ sign@@ ed l@@ etter on each S@@ if@@ t@@ able , and as you try to make wor@@ ds it ch@@ ec@@ ks ag@@ ain@@ st a dic@@ t@@ ion@@ ary .
Th@@ en , after about 30 secon@@ ds , it res@@ h@@ u@@ ff@@ les , and you have a new se@@ t of l@@ et@@ ter@@ s and new possi@@ bil@@ ities to try .
Thank you .
So these are some k@@ ids that came on a fi@@ el@@ d tri@@ p to the M@@ e@@ dia L@@ a@@ b , and I man@@ ag@@ ed to get them to try it out , and sh@@ oo@@ t a video .
They really l@@ ov@@ ed it .
And , one of the interest@@ ing things about this kind of ap@@ plic@@ ation is that you don &apos;t have to give people many in@@ str@@ uc@@ t@@ ions .
Al@@ l you have to say is , &quot; M@@ a@@ ke wor@@ ds , &quot; and they know ex@@ act@@ ly what to do .
So here &apos;s another few people trying it out .
That &apos;s our y@@ oun@@ g@@ est bet@@ a t@@ est@@ er , down there on the right .
T@@ ur@@ ns out , all he wanted to do was to st@@ ack the S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les up .
So to him , they were just bl@@ oc@@ ks .
Now , this is an inter@@ act@@ ive c@@ art@@ o@@ on ap@@ plic@@ ation .
And we wanted to buil@@ d a lear@@ ning t@@ ool for lan@@ gu@@ age lear@@ n@@ ers . And this is F@@ el@@ i@@ x , actually .
And he can br@@ ing new ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s into the sc@@ ene ,
just by lif@@ t@@ ing the S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les off the t@@ able that have that ch@@ ar@@ act@@ er sh@@ own on them .
H@@ ere , he &apos;s br@@ ing@@ ing the s@@ un out .
V@@ ide@@ o : The s@@ un is ris@@ ing .
D@@ av@@ id M@@ er@@ r@@ ill : Now he &apos;s br@@ ought a tr@@ act@@ or into the sc@@ ene .
V@@ ide@@ o : The or@@ an@@ ge tr@@ act@@ or .
G@@ ood jo@@ b ! Y@@ e@@ ah !
D@@ M : So by sh@@ a@@ king the S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les and p@@ utt@@ ing them next to each other he can make the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ s inter@@ act --
V@@ ide@@ o : W@@ o@@ of !
D@@ M : in@@ vent@@ ing his own n@@ arr@@ ative .
V@@ ide@@ o : H@@ ello !
D@@ M : It &apos;s an op@@ en@@ -@@ en@@ ded story ,
and he g@@ ets to deci@@ de how it un@@ f@@ ol@@ ds .
V@@ ide@@ o : F@@ ly away , c@@ at .
D@@ M : So , the last example I have time to show you today is a mus@@ ic se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ing and live per@@ for@@ man@@ ce t@@ ool
that we &apos;ve buil@@ t rec@@ ent@@ ly ,
in which S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les act as s@@ oun@@ ds like le@@ ad , bas@@ s and dr@@ um@@ s .
E@@ ach of these has four different v@@ ari@@ ations , you get to ch@@ o@@ ose which one you want to use .
And you can in@@ ject these s@@ oun@@ ds into a se@@ qu@@ ence that you can ass@@ em@@ ble into the pat@@ ter@@ n that you want .
And you in@@ ject it by just b@@ um@@ p@@ ing up the s@@ ound S@@ if@@ t@@ able ag@@ ain@@ st a se@@ qu@@ ence S@@ if@@ t@@ able .
There are eff@@ ects that you can contr@@ ol live , like re@@ ver@@ b and fil@@ ter .
You att@@ ach it to a partic@@ ular s@@ ound and then t@@ il@@ t to ad@@ just it .
And then , over@@ all eff@@ ects like tem@@ po and vol@@ um@@ e that app@@ ly to the ent@@ ire se@@ qu@@ ence .
So let &apos;s have a look .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : We &apos;ll start by p@@ utt@@ ing a le@@ ad into two se@@ qu@@ ence S@@ if@@ t@@ ab@@ les , ar@@ ran@@ ge them into a ser@@ ies , ex@@ t@@ end it , ad@@ d a little more le@@ ad .
Now I put a bas@@ s line in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : Now I &apos;ll put some perc@@ us@@ sion in .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the dr@@ um@@ s , so I can contr@@ ol the eff@@ ect live .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can spe@@ ed up the whole se@@ qu@@ ence by t@@ il@@ t@@ ing the tem@@ po one way or the other .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : And now I &apos;ll att@@ ach the fil@@ ter to the bas@@ s for some more ex@@ press@@ ion .
V@@ ide@@ o : D@@ M : I can re@@ ar@@ ran@@ ge the se@@ qu@@ ence wh@@ ile it pl@@ ays .
So I don &apos;t have to pl@@ an it out in ad@@ v@@ ance , but I can im@@ prov@@ ise , ma@@ king it l@@ ong@@ er or sh@@ or@@ ter as I go .
And now , fin@@ ally , I can f@@ ade the whole se@@ qu@@ ence out using the vol@@ um@@ e S@@ if@@ t@@ able , t@@ il@@ ted to the le@@ ft .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my p@@ as@@ sion is for ma@@ king new hum@@ an@@ -@@ computer inter@@ fac@@ es that are a better mat@@ ch to the ways our br@@ ain@@ s and bo@@ di@@ es work .
And today , I had time to show you one point in this new design sp@@ ace , and a few of the possi@@ bil@@ ities that we &apos;re working to br@@ ing out of the l@@ abor@@ at@@ ory .
So the thought I want to le@@ ave you with is that we &apos;re on the c@@ us@@ p of this new gener@@ ation of to@@ ol@@ s for inter@@ act@@ ing with dig@@ it@@ al media that are going to br@@ ing inform@@ ation into our world on our ter@@ ms .
Thank you very much .
I look for@@ w@@ ard to tal@@ king with all of you .
I am a w@@ rit@@ er .
W@@ rit@@ ing b@@ oo@@ ks is my prof@@ ess@@ ion but it &apos;s more than that , of course .
It is also my great lif@@ el@@ ong love and f@@ as@@ cin@@ ation .
And I don &apos;t ex@@ p@@ ect that that &apos;s ever going to change .
But , that said , something kind of p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar has happen@@ ed rec@@ ent@@ ly in my life and in my car@@ e@@ er , which has ca@@ used me to have to rec@@ al@@ i@@ br@@ ate my whole rel@@ at@@ ion@@ shi@@ p with this work .
And the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar thing is that I rec@@ ent@@ ly wr@@ ot@@ e this b@@ ook , this mem@@ o@@ ir called &quot; E@@ at , P@@ r@@ ay , L@@ ove &quot; which , deci@@ de@@ d@@ ly un@@ like any of my pre@@ vi@@ ous b@@ oo@@ ks , went out in the world for some reas@@ on , and bec@@ ame this big , me@@ g@@ a@@ -@@ sen@@ s@@ ation , inter@@ nat@@ ional b@@ est@@ s@@ ell@@ er thing .
The res@@ ult of which is that every@@ where I go now , people tre@@ at me like I &apos;m do@@ om@@ ed .
S@@ eri@@ ous@@ ly -- do@@ om@@ ed , do@@ om@@ ed !
L@@ i@@ ke , they come up to me now , all wor@@ ri@@ ed , and they say , &quot; A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you a@@ fr@@ aid you &apos;re never going to be able to to@@ p that ?
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you a@@ fr@@ aid you &apos;re going to ke@@ ep w@@ rit@@ ing for your whole life and you &apos;re never again going to create a b@@ ook that any@@ body in the world car@@ es about at all ,
ever again ? &quot;
So that &apos;s re@@ ass@@ ur@@ ing , you know .
But it would be wor@@ se , ex@@ ce@@ pt for that I happ@@ en to rem@@ em@@ ber that over 20 years ago , when I was a te@@ en@@ ag@@ er , when I first started t@@ ell@@ ing people that I wanted to be a w@@ rit@@ er ,
I was m@@ et with this same sort of f@@ ear@@ -@@ bas@@ ed re@@ act@@ ion .
And people would say , &quot; A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you a@@ fr@@ aid you &apos;re never going to have any succ@@ ess ?
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you a@@ fr@@ aid the hum@@ ili@@ ation of re@@ j@@ ect@@ ion will k@@ ill you ?
A@@ re@@ n &apos;t you a@@ fr@@ aid that you &apos;re going to work your whole life at this c@@ ra@@ ft and no@@ thing &apos;s ever going to come of it and you &apos;re going to di@@ e on a sc@@ ra@@ p he@@ a@@ p of br@@ o@@ k@@ en dre@@ am@@ s with your m@@ ou@@ th f@@ ill@@ ed with b@@ itt@@ er as@@ h of fa@@ il@@ ure ? &quot;
L@@ i@@ ke that , you know .
The ans@@ w@@ er -- the sh@@ or@@ t ans@@ w@@ er to all those quest@@ ions is , &quot; Y@@ es . &quot;
Y@@ es , I &apos;m a@@ fr@@ aid of all those things .
And I always have been .
And I &apos;m a@@ fr@@ aid of many , many more things b@@ es@@ ide@@ s that people can &apos;t even gu@@ ess at ,
like se@@ a@@ we@@ ed and other things that are sc@@ ary .
But , when it com@@ es to w@@ rit@@ ing , the thing that I &apos;ve been sort of thinking about l@@ at@@ ely , and w@@ on@@ der@@ ing about l@@ at@@ ely , is why ?
You know , is it r@@ at@@ ional ?
I@@ s it l@@ og@@ ical that any@@ body should be ex@@ p@@ ected to be a@@ fr@@ aid of the work that they feel they were put on this E@@ art@@ h to do .
And what is it spec@@ ific@@ ally about cre@@ ative vent@@ u@@ res that se@@ ems to make us really ner@@ v@@ ous about each other &apos;s ment@@ al heal@@ th in a way that other car@@ e@@ ers kind of don &apos;t do , you know ?
L@@ i@@ ke my d@@ ad , for example , was a ch@@ em@@ ical eng@@ in@@ e@@ er and I don &apos;t rec@@ all on@@ ce in his 4@@ 0 years of ch@@ em@@ ical eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing any@@ body as@@ king him if he was a@@ fr@@ aid to be a ch@@ em@@ ical eng@@ in@@ e@@ er , you know ?
&quot; That ch@@ em@@ ic@@ al@@ -@@ eng@@ in@@ e@@ er@@ ing bl@@ oc@@ k , J@@ o@@ h@@ n , how &apos;s it going ? &quot;
It just didn &apos;t come up like that , you know ?
But to be f@@ air , ch@@ em@@ ical eng@@ in@@ e@@ ers as a gr@@ ou@@ p hav@@ en &apos;t really ear@@ ned a re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation over the cent@@ ur@@ ies for being al@@ co@@ h@@ ol@@ ic man@@ ic@@ -@@ de@@ press@@ iv@@ es .
We w@@ rit@@ ers , we kind of do have that re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation , and not just w@@ rit@@ ers , but cre@@ ative people ac@@ ros@@ s all gen@@ res , it se@@ ems , have this re@@ p@@ ut@@ ation for being en@@ or@@ m@@ ous@@ ly ment@@ ally un@@ st@@ able .
And all you have to do is look at the very g@@ ri@@ m de@@ at@@ h coun@@ t in the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y al@@ one , of really mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent cre@@ ative min@@ ds who di@@ ed y@@ oun@@ g and of@@ t@@ en at their own h@@ ands , you know ?
And even the ones who didn &apos;t l@@ it@@ er@@ ally comm@@ it su@@ ic@@ ide se@@ e@@ m to be really un@@ done by their gi@@ f@@ ts , you know .
N@@ or@@ man M@@ a@@ il@@ er , just before he di@@ ed , last inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w , he said , &quot; E@@ very one of my b@@ oo@@ ks has k@@ ill@@ ed me a little more . &quot; A@@ n ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary stat@@ ement to make about your life &apos;s work .
But we don &apos;t even bl@@ in@@ k when we he@@ ar som@@ eb@@ ody say this , because we &apos;ve hear@@ d that kind of stu@@ f@@ f for so long and some@@ how we &apos;ve complet@@ ely inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized and acc@@ ep@@ ted coll@@ ect@@ iv@@ ely this not@@ ion that creat@@ iv@@ ity and su@@ ff@@ er@@ ing are some@@ how in@@ h@@ er@@ ent@@ ly lin@@ ked and that art@@ is@@ try , in the end , will always ultim@@ at@@ ely le@@ ad to an@@ gu@@ is@@ h .
And the question that I want to as@@ k every@@ body here today is are you gu@@ y@@ s all c@@ ool with that idea ?
A@@ re you com@@ fort@@ able with that ? Because you look at it even from an in@@ ch away and , you know -- I &apos;m not at all com@@ fort@@ able with that as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion .
I think it &apos;s o@@ di@@ ous .
And I also think it &apos;s d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous , and I don &apos;t want to see it per@@ p@@ et@@ u@@ ated into the next cent@@ ur@@ y .
I think it &apos;s better if we en@@ cour@@ age our great cre@@ ative min@@ ds to live .
And I defin@@ it@@ ely know that , in my case -- in my s@@ itu@@ ation -- it would be very d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous for me to start sort of le@@ a@@ king down that d@@ ar@@ k pat@@ h of as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion , partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly giv@@ en the cir@@ c@@ um@@ st@@ ance that I &apos;m in right now in my car@@ e@@ er .
Wh@@ ich is -- you know , like ch@@ ec@@ k it out , I &apos;m pret@@ ty y@@ oun@@ g , I &apos;m only about 4@@ 0 years old .
I still have ma@@ y@@ be another four de@@ ca@@ de@@ s of work le@@ ft in me .
And it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly li@@ k@@ ely that any@@ thing I wr@@ ite from this point for@@ w@@ ard is going to be j@@ ud@@ g@@ ed by the world as the work that came after the fre@@ ak@@ is@@ h succ@@ ess of my last b@@ ook , right ?
I should just put it bl@@ un@@ t@@ ly , because we &apos;re all sort of fri@@ end@@ s here now -- it &apos;s ex@@ ce@@ ed@@ ing@@ ly li@@ k@@ ely that my gre@@ at@@ est succ@@ ess is be@@ h@@ ind me .
So J@@ es@@ us , what a thought !
That &apos;s the kind of thought that could le@@ ad a pers@@ on to start dr@@ in@@ king g@@ in at n@@ ine o &apos;@@ cl@@ oc@@ k in the mor@@ ning , and I don &apos;t want to go there .
I would pre@@ f@@ er to ke@@ ep doing this work that I love .
And so , the question bec@@ om@@ es , how ?
And so , it se@@ ems to me , up@@ on a lot of re@@ fl@@ ect@@ ion , that the way that I have to work now , in ord@@ er to contin@@ ue w@@ rit@@ ing , is that I have to create some sort of prot@@ ect@@ ive p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ str@@ uc@@ t , right ?
I have to sort of find some way to have a s@@ af@@ e dist@@ ance between me , as I am w@@ rit@@ ing , and my very natur@@ al an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y about what the re@@ act@@ ion to that w@@ rit@@ ing is going to be , from now on . And , as I &apos;ve been looking , over the last year , for model@@ s for how to do that , I &apos;ve been sort of looking ac@@ ros@@ s time , and I &apos;ve been trying to find other soci@@ et@@ ies to see if they might have had better and s@@ an@@ er ide@@ as than we have
about how to help cre@@ ative people sort of man@@ age the in@@ h@@ er@@ ent em@@ ot@@ ional ris@@ ks of creat@@ iv@@ ity .
And that se@@ ar@@ ch has l@@ ed me to an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ece and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome .
So st@@ ay with me , because it does cir@@ c@@ le around and back .
But , an@@ ci@@ ent G@@ re@@ ece and an@@ ci@@ ent R@@ ome -- people did not happ@@ en to believe that creat@@ iv@@ ity came from human be@@ ings back then , O@@ K ?
P@@ e@@ ople beli@@ ev@@ ed that creat@@ iv@@ ity was this di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spi@@ r@@ it that came to human be@@ ings from some dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able s@@ our@@ ce , for dist@@ ant and un@@ know@@ able reas@@ ons .
The G@@ re@@ e@@ ks fam@@ ous@@ ly called these di@@ v@@ ine att@@ end@@ ant spi@@ rit@@ s of creat@@ iv@@ ity &quot; d@@ a@@ em@@ ons . &quot;
S@@ oc@@ r@@ ates , fam@@ ous@@ ly , beli@@ ev@@ ed that he had a d@@ a@@ em@@ on who sp@@ o@@ ke w@@ is@@ d@@ om to him from af@@ ar .
The R@@ om@@ ans had the same idea , but they called that sort of di@@ sem@@ bo@@ di@@ ed cre@@ ative spi@@ r@@ it a gen@@ i@@ us .
Wh@@ ich is great , because the R@@ om@@ ans did not actually think that a gen@@ i@@ us was a partic@@ ul@@ ar@@ ly cl@@ ever individu@@ al .
They beli@@ ev@@ ed that a gen@@ i@@ us was this , sort of mag@@ ical di@@ v@@ ine ent@@ ity , who was beli@@ ev@@ ed to l@@ it@@ er@@ ally live in the w@@ all@@ s of an art@@ ist &apos;s stu@@ dio , kind of like D@@ ob@@ by the h@@ ou@@ se el@@ f , and who would come out and sort of in@@ vis@@ i@@ b@@ ly ass@@ ist the art@@ ist with their work and would sh@@ ap@@ e the out@@ come of that work .
So br@@ il@@ li@@ ant -- there it is , right there , that dist@@ ance that I &apos;m tal@@ king about -- that p@@ sy@@ ch@@ olog@@ ical con@@ str@@ uc@@ t to prot@@ ect you from the res@@ ult@@ s of your work .
And every@@ one k@@ new that this is how it fun@@ c@@ t@@ ion@@ ed , right ?
So the an@@ ci@@ ent art@@ ist was prot@@ ected from cer@@ ta@@ in things , like , for example , too much n@@ ar@@ cis@@ s@@ ism , right ?
If your work was br@@ il@@ li@@ ant , you c@@ ouldn &apos;t take all the cre@@ di@@ t for it , every@@ body k@@ new that you had this di@@ sem@@ bo@@ di@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us who had hel@@ p@@ ed you .
If your work b@@ om@@ b@@ ed , not ent@@ ir@@ ely your fa@@ ult , you know ?
E@@ ver@@ y@@ one k@@ new your gen@@ i@@ us was kind of l@@ ame .
And this is how people thought about creat@@ iv@@ ity in the W@@ est for a really long time .
And then the R@@ en@@ a@@ is@@ s@@ ance came and every@@ thing chang@@ ed , and we had this big idea , and the big idea was , let &apos;s put the individu@@ al human being at the cent@@ er of the univer@@ se ab@@ ove all go@@ ds and my@@ st@@ er@@ ies , and there &apos;s no more room for my@@ st@@ ical creat@@ u@@ res who take dic@@ t@@ ation from the di@@ v@@ ine .
And it &apos;s the beg@@ in@@ ning of r@@ at@@ ional hum@@ an@@ ism , and people started to believe that creat@@ iv@@ ity came complet@@ ely from the self of the individu@@ al .
And for the first time in h@@ ist@@ ory , you start to he@@ ar people re@@ fer@@ r@@ ing to this or that art@@ ist as being a gen@@ i@@ us , ra@@ ther than hav@@ ing a gen@@ i@@ us .
And I got to tell you , I think that was a h@@ u@@ ge er@@ r@@ or .
You know , I think that all@@ owing som@@ eb@@ ody , one m@@ ere pers@@ on to believe that he or she is like , the v@@ ess@@ el , you know , like the fon@@ t and the ess@@ ence and the s@@ our@@ ce of all di@@ v@@ ine , cre@@ ative , un@@ know@@ able , et@@ er@@ n@@ al my@@ st@@ er@@ y is just a sm@@ id@@ ge too much respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity to put on one fr@@ ag@@ ile , human p@@ sy@@ che .
It &apos;s like as@@ king som@@ eb@@ ody to s@@ w@@ all@@ ow the s@@ un .
It just complet@@ ely w@@ ar@@ ps and di@@ stor@@ ts e@@ go@@ s , and it cre@@ ates all these un@@ man@@ ag@@ e@@ able ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations about per@@ for@@ man@@ ce .
And I think the press@@ ure of that has been k@@ ill@@ ing off our art@@ ists for the last 5@@ 00 years .
And , if this is tru@@ e , and I think it is tru@@ e , the question bec@@ om@@ es , what now ?
C@@ an we do this differ@@ ent@@ ly ?
M@@ ay@@ be go back to some more an@@ ci@@ ent underst@@ and@@ ing about the rel@@ at@@ ion@@ shi@@ p between hum@@ ans and the cre@@ ative my@@ st@@ er@@ y .
M@@ ay@@ be not .
M@@ ay@@ be we can &apos;t just er@@ ase 5@@ 00 years of r@@ at@@ ional hum@@ an@@ ist@@ ic thought in one 1@@ 8 min@@ ute spe@@ ec@@ h .
And there &apos;s prob@@ ably people in this au@@ di@@ ence who would ra@@ ise really leg@@ it@@ im@@ ate scient@@ if@@ ic s@@ us@@ pic@@ ions about the not@@ ion of , bas@@ ically , f@@ ai@@ ri@@ es who f@@ oll@@ ow people around r@@ ub@@ b@@ ing fa@@ ir@@ y j@@ u@@ ice on their pro@@ j@@ ects and stu@@ f@@ f .
I &apos;m not , prob@@ ably , going to br@@ ing you all al@@ ong with me on this .
But the question that I kind of want to pos@@ e is -- you know , why not ?
Wh@@ y not think about it this way ?
Because it ma@@ kes as much sen@@ se as any@@ thing el@@ se I have ever hear@@ d in ter@@ ms of expl@@ ain@@ ing the utt@@ er m@@ ad@@ d@@ en@@ ing cap@@ ric@@ i@@ ous@@ ness of the cre@@ ative proc@@ ess .
A proc@@ ess which , as any@@ body who has ever tri@@ ed to make something -- which is to say bas@@ ically every@@ one here -@@ -- know@@ s does not always be@@ have r@@ at@@ ion@@ ally .
And , in fact , can som@@ et@@ im@@ es feel d@@ ow@@ n@@ right par@@ an@@ or@@ m@@ al .
I had this en@@ coun@@ ter rec@@ ent@@ ly where I m@@ et the ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary Amer@@ ic@@ an po@@ et R@@ ut@@ h St@@ one , who &apos;s now in her 9@@ 0@@ s , but she &apos;s been a po@@ et her ent@@ ire life and she t@@ old me that when she was gr@@ owing up in r@@ ur@@ al V@@ ir@@ g@@ in@@ ia , she would be out working in the fi@@ el@@ ds , and she said she would feel and he@@ ar a po@@ e@@ m com@@ ing at her from over the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
And she said it was like a th@@ under@@ ous tr@@ ain of air .
And it would come bar@@ rel@@ ing down at her over the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e .
And she fel@@ t it com@@ ing , because it would sh@@ a@@ ke the ear@@ th un@@ der her fe@@ et .
S@@ he k@@ new that she had only one thing to do at that point , and that was to , in her wor@@ ds , &quot; r@@ un like h@@ ell . &quot;
And she would r@@ un like h@@ ell to the h@@ ou@@ se and she would be gett@@ ing ch@@ as@@ ed by this po@@ e@@ m , and the whole de@@ al was that she had to get to a pi@@ ece of p@@ ap@@ er and a pen@@ c@@ il f@@ ast en@@ ough so that when it th@@ under@@ ed through her , she could coll@@ ect it and gra@@ b it on the p@@ age .
And other tim@@ es she w@@ ouldn &apos;t be f@@ ast en@@ ough , so she &apos;d be r@@ un@@ ning and r@@ un@@ ning , and she w@@ ouldn &apos;t get to the h@@ ou@@ se and the po@@ e@@ m would bar@@ re@@ l through her and she would mis@@ s it and she said it would contin@@ ue on ac@@ ros@@ s the l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , looking , as she put it &quot; for another po@@ et . &quot;
And then there were these tim@@ es -- this is the pi@@ ece I never for@@ got -- she said that there were mom@@ ents where she would al@@ most mis@@ s it , right ?
So , she &apos;s r@@ un@@ ning to the h@@ ou@@ se and she &apos;s looking for the p@@ ap@@ er and the po@@ e@@ m pass@@ es through her , and she gr@@ ab@@ s a pen@@ c@@ il just as it &apos;s going through her , and then she said , it was like she would re@@ ach out with her other h@@ and and she would cat@@ ch it .
S@@ he would cat@@ ch the po@@ e@@ m by its ta@@ il , and she would p@@ ul@@ l it b@@ ack@@ w@@ ar@@ ds into her body as she was tr@@ an@@ scri@@ b@@ ing on the p@@ age .
And in these inst@@ an@@ ces , the po@@ e@@ m would come up on the p@@ age per@@ f@@ ect and int@@ act but b@@ ack@@ w@@ ar@@ ds , from the last wor@@ d to the first .
So when I hear@@ d that I was like -- that &apos;s un@@ can@@ n@@ y , that &apos;s ex@@ act@@ ly what my cre@@ ative proc@@ ess is like .
That &apos;s not at all what my cre@@ ative proc@@ ess is -- I &apos;m not the pi@@ p@@ el@@ ine !
I &apos;m a m@@ u@@ le , and the way that I have to work is I have to get up at the same time every day , and s@@ we@@ at and l@@ ab@@ or and bar@@ re@@ l through it really aw@@ k@@ w@@ ard@@ ly .
But even I , in my m@@ u@@ li@@ sh@@ ness , even I have br@@ us@@ h@@ ed up ag@@ ain@@ st that thing , at tim@@ es .
And I would imag@@ ine that a lot of you have too .
You know , even I have had work or ide@@ as come through me from a s@@ our@@ ce that I h@@ on@@ est@@ ly can@@ not id@@ ent@@ if@@ y .
And what is that thing ?
And how are we to rel@@ ate to it in a way that will not make us l@@ ose our min@@ ds , but , in fact , might actually ke@@ ep us s@@ ane ?
And for me , the b@@ est cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary example that I have of how to do that is the mus@@ ici@@ an T@@ om W@@ a@@ its , who I got to inter@@ vi@@ e@@ w s@@ ever@@ al years ago on a mag@@ az@@ ine as@@ sign@@ ment .
And we were tal@@ king about this , and you know , T@@ om , for most of his life , he was pret@@ ty much the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of the tor@@ ment@@ ed cont@@ em@@ por@@ ary mo@@ der@@ n art@@ ist , trying to contr@@ ol and man@@ age and dom@@ in@@ ate these sort of un@@ contr@@ oll@@ able cre@@ ative imp@@ ul@@ s@@ es that were t@@ ot@@ ally inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized .
But then he got ol@@ der , he got cal@@ m@@ er , and one day he was d@@ riv@@ ing down the fre@@ e@@ way in L@@ os An@@ g@@ el@@ es , and this is when it all chang@@ ed for him .
And he &apos;s spe@@ ed@@ ing al@@ ong , and all of a su@@ d@@ de@@ n he hear@@ s this little fr@@ ag@@ ment of m@@ el@@ ody , that com@@ es into his he@@ ad as in@@ spi@@ r@@ ation of@@ t@@ en com@@ es , el@@ us@@ ive and t@@ ant@@ al@@ iz@@ ing , and he want@@ s it , it &apos;s g@@ org@@ e@@ ous , and he l@@ ong@@ s for it , but he has no way to get it .
He doesn &apos;t have a pi@@ ece of p@@ ap@@ er , or a pen@@ c@@ il , or a t@@ ap@@ e re@@ cor@@ der .
So he start@@ s to feel all of that old an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y start to ris@@ e in him like , &quot; I &apos;m going to l@@ ose this thing , and I &apos;ll be be h@@ a@@ un@@ ted by this s@@ ong for@@ ever .
I &apos;m not good en@@ ough , and I can &apos;t do it . &quot;
And in@@ ste@@ ad of p@@ an@@ ic@@ king , he just st@@ op@@ p@@ ed .
He just st@@ op@@ p@@ ed that whole ment@@ al proc@@ ess and he did something complet@@ ely n@@ ov@@ el .
He just loo@@ ked up at the sk@@ y , and he said , &quot; E@@ x@@ c@@ use me , can you not see that I &apos;m d@@ riv@@ ing ? &quot;
&quot; D@@ o I look like I can wr@@ ite down a s@@ ong right now ?
If you really want to ex@@ ist , come back at a more opport@@ un@@ e mom@@ ent when I can take care of you .
O@@ ther@@ w@@ ise , go b@@ other som@@ eb@@ ody el@@ se today .
G@@ o b@@ other L@@ e@@ on@@ ard C@@ o@@ h@@ en . &quot;
And his whole work proc@@ ess chang@@ ed after that .
N@@ ot the work , the work was still of@@ t@@ ent@@ im@@ es as d@@ ar@@ k as ever .
But the proc@@ ess , and the he@@ av@@ y an@@ x@@ i@@ et@@ y around it was rel@@ e@@ as@@ ed when he t@@ ook the gen@@ ie , the gen@@ i@@ us out of him where it was ca@@ using no@@ thing but tr@@ ou@@ ble , and rel@@ e@@ as@@ ed it back where it came from , and real@@ ized that this didn &apos;t have to be this inter@@ n@@ al@@ ized , tor@@ ment@@ ed thing .
It could be this p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar , w@@ on@@ dr@@ ous , bi@@ z@@ ar@@ re coll@@ abor@@ ation , kind of con@@ ver@@ s@@ ation between T@@ om and the str@@ an@@ ge , ex@@ ter@@ n@@ al thing that was not qu@@ ite T@@ om .
When I hear@@ d that story , it started to sh@@ if@@ t a little bit the way that I wor@@ ked too , and this idea al@@ read@@ y s@@ av@@ ed me on@@ ce .
It s@@ av@@ ed me when I was in the m@@ id@@ d@@ le of w@@ rit@@ ing &quot; E@@ at , P@@ r@@ ay , L@@ ove , &quot; and I f@@ ell into one of those sort of p@@ its of des@@ p@@ air that we all f@@ all into when we &apos;re working on something and it &apos;s not com@@ ing and you start to think this is going to be a dis@@ ast@@ er , the wor@@ st b@@ ook ever wr@@ itt@@ en .
N@@ ot just b@@ ad , but the wor@@ st b@@ ook ever wr@@ itt@@ en .
And I started to think I should just d@@ um@@ p this pro@@ ject .
But then I rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed T@@ om tal@@ king to the op@@ en air and I tri@@ ed it .
So I just lif@@ ted my face up from the man@@ us@@ c@@ ri@@ pt and I di@@ rec@@ ted my comm@@ ents to an em@@ p@@ ty cor@@ ner of the room .
And I said al@@ ou@@ d , &quot; L@@ ist@@ en you , thing , you and I b@@ ot@@ h know that if this b@@ ook is@@ n &apos;t br@@ il@@ li@@ ant that is not ent@@ ir@@ ely my fa@@ ult , right ?
Because you can see that I am p@@ utt@@ ing every@@ thing I have into this , I don &apos;t have any more than this .
If you want it to be better , you &apos;ve got to show up and do your part of the de@@ al .
But if you don &apos;t do that , you know what , the h@@ ell with it .
I &apos;m going to ke@@ ep w@@ rit@@ ing any@@ way because that &apos;s my jo@@ b .
And I would p@@ le@@ ase like the re@@ cor@@ d to re@@ fl@@ ect today that I sh@@ ow@@ ed up for my part of the jo@@ b . &quot; Because -- Because in the end it &apos;s like this , O@@ K -- cent@@ ur@@ ies ago in the des@@ er@@ ts of N@@ or@@ th Africa , people used to g@@ a@@ ther for these mo@@ on@@ light d@@ an@@ ces of s@@ ac@@ red d@@ ance and mus@@ ic that would go on for h@@ our@@ s and h@@ our@@ s , un@@ t@@ il d@@ aw@@ n .
They were always mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent , because the d@@ anc@@ ers were prof@@ ess@@ ion@@ als and they were ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ic , right ?
But every on@@ ce in a wh@@ ile , very r@@ ar@@ ely , something would happ@@ en , and one of these per@@ form@@ ers would actually bec@@ ome tr@@ an@@ sc@@ end@@ ent .
And I know you know what I &apos;m tal@@ king about , because I know you &apos;ve all se@@ en , at some point in your life , a per@@ for@@ man@@ ce like this .
It was like time would st@@ op , and the d@@ anc@@ er would sort of ste@@ p through some kind of port@@ al and he w@@ as@@ n &apos;t doing any@@ thing different than he had ever done , 1@@ ,000 n@@ igh@@ ts before , but every@@ thing would al@@ ig@@ n .
And all of a su@@ d@@ de@@ n , he would no l@@ ong@@ er ap@@ pe@@ ar to be mer@@ ely human .
He would be li@@ t from with@@ in , and li@@ t from bel@@ ow and all li@@ t up on f@@ ire with di@@ v@@ in@@ ity .
And when this happen@@ ed , back then , people k@@ new it for what it was , you know , they called it by its n@@ ame .
They would put their h@@ ands together and they would start to ch@@ ant , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Go@@ d , Go@@ d , Go@@ d . &quot;
That &apos;s Go@@ d , you know .
C@@ ur@@ i@@ ous h@@ ist@@ or@@ ical f@@ o@@ ot@@ not@@ e : when the M@@ o@@ ors inv@@ a@@ ded s@@ ou@@ ther@@ n S@@ pa@@ in , they t@@ ook this cu@@ st@@ om with them and the pr@@ on@@ un@@ ci@@ ation chang@@ ed over the cent@@ ur@@ ies from &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , Al@@ la@@ h , &quot; to &quot; O@@ l@@ é , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , &quot; which you still he@@ ar in b@@ ul@@ l@@ f@@ igh@@ ts and in fl@@ am@@ en@@ co d@@ an@@ ces .
In S@@ pa@@ in , when a per@@ form@@ er has done something im@@ possi@@ ble and mag@@ ic , &quot; Al@@ la@@ h , ol@@ é , ol@@ é , Al@@ la@@ h , mag@@ n@@ ific@@ ent , br@@ av@@ o , &quot; in@@ com@@ pre@@ h@@ en@@ si@@ ble , there it is -- a gl@@ imp@@ se of Go@@ d .
Wh@@ ich is great , because we need that .
But , the tr@@ ick@@ y bit com@@ es the next mor@@ ning , for the d@@ anc@@ er h@@ im@@ self , when he w@@ a@@ kes up and disc@@ ov@@ ers that it &apos;s T@@ u@@ es@@ day at 1@@ 1 a@@ .@@ m@@ . , and he &apos;s no l@@ ong@@ er a gl@@ imp@@ se of Go@@ d .
He &apos;s just an ag@@ ing mor@@ t@@ al with really b@@ ad k@@ ne@@ es , and ma@@ y@@ be he &apos;s never going to as@@ c@@ end to that he@@ ight again .
And ma@@ y@@ be no@@ body will ever ch@@ ant Go@@ d &apos;s n@@ ame again as he sp@@ ins , and what is he then to do with the res@@ t of his life ?
This is h@@ ard .
This is one of the most pa@@ in@@ ful re@@ con@@ ci@@ li@@ ations to make in a cre@@ ative life .
But ma@@ y@@ be it doesn &apos;t have to be qu@@ ite so f@@ ul@@ l of an@@ gu@@ is@@ h if you never happen@@ ed to believe , in the first place , that the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary asp@@ ects of your being came from you .
But ma@@ y@@ be if you just beli@@ ev@@ ed that they were on l@@ o@@ an to you from some un@@ imag@@ in@@ able s@@ our@@ ce for some ex@@ qu@@ is@@ ite port@@ ion of your life to be pass@@ ed al@@ ong when you &apos;re fin@@ is@@ h@@ ed , with som@@ eb@@ ody el@@ se .
And , you know , if we think about it this way , it start@@ s to change every@@ thing .
This is how I &apos;ve started to think , and this is cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly how I &apos;ve been thinking in the last few mon@@ th@@ s as I &apos;ve been working on the b@@ ook that will so@@ on be pub@@ li@@ sh@@ ed , as the d@@ ang@@ er@@ ous@@ ly , fr@@ igh@@ ten@@ ing@@ ly over@@ -@@ ant@@ ici@@ p@@ ated f@@ oll@@ ow up to my fre@@ ak@@ is@@ h succ@@ ess .
And what I have to sort of ke@@ ep t@@ ell@@ ing my@@ self when I get really p@@ sy@@ ch@@ ed out about that is don &apos;t be a@@ fr@@ aid .
D@@ on &apos;t be d@@ a@@ un@@ ted . J@@ ust do your jo@@ b .
Con@@ t@@ in@@ ue to show up for your pi@@ ece of it , wh@@ at@@ ever that might be .
If your jo@@ b is to d@@ ance , do your d@@ ance .
If the di@@ v@@ ine , c@@ oc@@ ke@@ y@@ ed gen@@ i@@ us as@@ sign@@ ed to your case deci@@ de@@ s to let some sort of w@@ on@@ der@@ ment be gl@@ imp@@ s@@ ed , for just one mom@@ ent through your ef@@ for@@ ts , then &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot;
And if not , do your d@@ ance any@@ how .
And &quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , non@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess .
I believe this and I feel that we m@@ ust te@@ ach it .
&quot; O@@ l@@ é ! &quot; to you , non@@ e@@ th@@ el@@ ess , just for hav@@ ing the sh@@ e@@ er human love and stu@@ b@@ bor@@ n@@ ness to ke@@ ep sh@@ owing up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
J@@ un@@ e C@@ o@@ h@@ en : O@@ l@@ é !
You know , I &apos;ve tal@@ ked about some of these pro@@ j@@ ects before -- about the human gen@@ ome and what that might mean , and disc@@ over@@ ing new s@@ ets of gen@@ es .
We &apos;re actually start@@ ing at a new point : we &apos;ve been dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing bi@@ olog@@ y , and now we &apos;re trying to go from that dig@@ it@@ al c@@ od@@ e into a new ph@@ ase of bi@@ olog@@ y with desig@@ ning and sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ing life .
So , we &apos;ve always been trying to as@@ k big quest@@ ions .
&quot; What is life ? &quot; is something that I think many bi@@ olog@@ ists have been trying to understand at v@@ ari@@ ous l@@ ev@@ el@@ s .
We &apos;ve tri@@ ed v@@ ari@@ ous ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es , par@@ ing it down to min@@ im@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents .
We &apos;ve been dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing it now for al@@ most 20 years ;
when we se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ed the human gen@@ ome , it was going from the an@@ al@@ o@@ g world of bi@@ olog@@ y into the dig@@ it@@ al world of the computer .
Now we &apos;re trying to as@@ k , &quot; C@@ an we re@@ gener@@ ate life or can we create new life out of this dig@@ it@@ al univer@@ se ? &quot;
This is the ma@@ p of a sm@@ all organ@@ ism , M@@ y@@ c@@ op@@ l@@ as@@ ma gen@@ it@@ al@@ i@@ um , that has the sm@@ all@@ est gen@@ ome for a spec@@ ies that can sel@@ f@@ -@@ re@@ plic@@ ate in the l@@ abor@@ at@@ ory ,
and we &apos;ve been trying to just see if we can come up with an even sm@@ all@@ er gen@@ ome .
We &apos;re able to k@@ no@@ c@@ k out on the ord@@ er of 100 gen@@ es out of the 5@@ 00 or so that are here .
When we look at its met@@ ab@@ ol@@ ic ma@@ p , it &apos;s rel@@ at@@ iv@@ ely sim@@ ple com@@ par@@ ed to our@@ s --
tr@@ ust me , this is sim@@ ple --
but when we look at all the gen@@ es that we can k@@ no@@ c@@ k out one at a time , it &apos;s very un@@ li@@ k@@ ely that this would y@@ i@@ el@@ d a liv@@ ing c@@ ell .
So we deci@@ ded the only way for@@ w@@ ard was to actually sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ ize this ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome so we could v@@ ary the comp@@ on@@ ents to as@@ k some of these most fun@@ dam@@ ent@@ al quest@@ ions .
And so we started down the ro@@ ad of : can we sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ ize a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome ?
C@@ an ch@@ em@@ is@@ try per@@ m@@ it ma@@ king these really l@@ ar@@ ge mol@@ ec@@ ul@@ es where we &apos;ve never been before ?
And if we do , can we b@@ oo@@ t up a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome ?
A ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome , by the way , is just a pi@@ ece of in@@ er@@ t ch@@ em@@ ical materi@@ al .
So , our p@@ ace of dig@@ it@@ iz@@ ing life has been incre@@ as@@ ing at an ex@@ pon@@ ent@@ ial p@@ ace .
O@@ u@@ r abil@@ ity to wr@@ ite the gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e has been mov@@ ing pret@@ ty sl@@ ow@@ ly but has been incre@@ as@@ ing ,
and our l@@ at@@ est point would put it on , now , an ex@@ pon@@ ent@@ ial cur@@ ve .
We started this over 1@@ 5 years ago .
It t@@ ook s@@ ever@@ al st@@ ag@@ es , in fact , start@@ ing with a bi@@ o@@ e@@ th@@ ical re@@ vi@@ e@@ w before we did the first ex@@ per@@ im@@ ents .
But it tur@@ ns out sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ iz@@ ing D@@ N@@ A is very diffic@@ ult .
There are ten@@ s of th@@ ous@@ ands of ma@@ ch@@ in@@ es around the world that make sm@@ all pi@@ ec@@ es of D@@ N@@ A -- 30 to 50 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s in l@@ eng@@ th -- and it &apos;s a de@@ gener@@ ate proc@@ ess , so the l@@ ong@@ er you make the pi@@ ece , the more er@@ r@@ ors there are .
So we had to create a new me@@ th@@ o@@ d for p@@ utt@@ ing these little pi@@ ec@@ es together and cor@@ rec@@ t all the er@@ r@@ ors .
And this was our first att@@ em@@ pt , start@@ ing with the dig@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation of the gen@@ ome of ph@@ i X@@ 1@@ 7@@ 4 .
It &apos;s a sm@@ all vir@@ us that k@@ ill@@ s b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia .
We desig@@ ned the pi@@ ec@@ es , went through our er@@ r@@ or cor@@ rec@@ tion and had a D@@ N@@ A mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le of about 5@@ ,000 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s .
The ex@@ cit@@ ing ph@@ ase came when we t@@ ook this pi@@ ece of in@@ er@@ t ch@@ em@@ ical and put it in the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia , and the b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia started to re@@ ad this gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e , made the vir@@ al partic@@ les .
The vir@@ al partic@@ les then were rel@@ e@@ as@@ ed from the cell@@ s and came back and k@@ ill@@ ed the E@@ . col@@ i .
I was tal@@ king to the o@@ il ind@@ us@@ try rec@@ ent@@ ly and I said they c@@ lear@@ ly underst@@ ood that mo@@ del .
They l@@ au@@ gh@@ ed more than you gu@@ y@@ s are .
And so , we think this is a s@@ itu@@ ation where the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are can actually buil@@ d its own h@@ ard@@ w@@ are in a bi@@ olog@@ ical system .
But we wanted to go much l@@ arg@@ er :
we wanted to buil@@ d the ent@@ ire b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ial ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome --
it &apos;s over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s of gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e --
so we thought we &apos;d buil@@ d them in c@@ ass@@ ett@@ es the si@@ z@@ e of the vir@@ us@@ es so we could actually v@@ ary the c@@ ass@@ ett@@ es to understand what the act@@ u@@ al comp@@ on@@ ents of a liv@@ ing c@@ ell are .
D@@ es@@ ig@@ n is cr@@ it@@ ical , and if you &apos;re start@@ ing with dig@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation in the computer , that dig@@ it@@ al inform@@ ation has to be really acc@@ ur@@ ate .
When we first se@@ qu@@ en@@ c@@ ed this gen@@ ome in 19@@ 9@@ 5 , the st@@ and@@ ard of acc@@ ur@@ ac@@ y was one er@@ r@@ or per 1@@ 0@@ ,000 bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s .
We actually found , on res@@ equ@@ en@@ c@@ ing it , 30 er@@ r@@ ors ; had we used that or@@ ig@@ in@@ al se@@ qu@@ ence , it never would have been able to be bo@@ ot@@ ed up .
P@@ art of the design is desig@@ ning pi@@ ec@@ es that are 50 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s long that have to over@@ la@@ p with all the other 5@@ 0@@ -@@ l@@ etter pi@@ ec@@ es to buil@@ d sm@@ all@@ er sub@@ un@@ its we have to design so they can go together .
We design un@@ i@@ que el@@ em@@ ents into this .
You may have re@@ ad that we put w@@ at@@ er@@ mar@@ ks in .
Th@@ in@@ k of this : we have a f@@ our@@ -@@ l@@ etter gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e -- A , C , G and T@@ .
T@@ ri@@ pl@@ ets of those l@@ et@@ ter@@ s c@@ od@@ e for r@@ oug@@ h@@ ly 20 am@@ ino ac@@ ids , su@@ ch that there &apos;s a sing@@ le l@@ etter desig@@ n@@ ation for each of the am@@ ino ac@@ ids .
So we can use the gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e to wr@@ ite out wor@@ ds , sent@@ en@@ ces , th@@ oug@@ h@@ ts .
In@@ it@@ i@@ ally , all we did was aut@@ og@@ rap@@ h it .
S@@ ome people were dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ed there was not po@@ e@@ try .
We desig@@ ned these pi@@ ec@@ es so we can just ch@@ e@@ w back with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es ;
there are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that re@@ p@@ air them and put them together .
And we started ma@@ king pi@@ ec@@ es , start@@ ing with pi@@ ec@@ es that were 5@@ ,000 to 7@@ ,000 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s , put those together to make 2@@ 4@@ ,@@ 0@@ 0@@ 0@@ -@@ l@@ etter pi@@ ec@@ es , then put s@@ ets of those going up to 7@@ 2@@ ,000 .
A@@ t each st@@ age , we gre@@ w up these pi@@ ec@@ es in ab@@ un@@ d@@ ance so we could se@@ qu@@ ence them because we &apos;re trying to create a proc@@ ess that &apos;s ex@@ trem@@ ely rob@@ ust that you can see in a min@@ ute .
We &apos;re trying to get to the point of aut@@ om@@ ation .
So , this loo@@ ks like a bas@@ k@@ et@@ b@@ all pl@@ ay@@ off .
When we get into these really l@@ ar@@ ge pi@@ ec@@ es over 1@@ 0@@ 0@@ ,000 bas@@ e pa@@ ir@@ s , they w@@ on &apos;t any l@@ ong@@ er gr@@ ow re@@ a@@ di@@ ly in E@@ . col@@ i --
it ex@@ h@@ au@@ st@@ s all the mo@@ der@@ n to@@ ol@@ s of mol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ olog@@ y --
and so we tur@@ ned to other me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms .
We k@@ new there &apos;s a me@@ chan@@ ism called h@@ om@@ olog@@ ous re@@ com@@ b@@ in@@ ation that bi@@ olog@@ y us@@ es to re@@ p@@ air D@@ N@@ A that can put pi@@ ec@@ es together .
H@@ ere &apos;s an example of it :
there &apos;s an organ@@ ism called D@@ e@@ in@@ oc@@ occu@@ s ra@@ di@@ od@@ ur@@ ans that can take three mil@@ li@@ ons r@@ ad@@ s of ra@@ di@@ ation .
You can see in the to@@ p p@@ an@@ el , its ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome just g@@ ets bl@@ own ap@@ art .
T@@ w@@ el@@ ve to 2@@ 4 h@@ our@@ s l@@ ater , it put it back together ex@@ act@@ ly as it was before .
We have th@@ ous@@ ands of organ@@ is@@ ms that can do this .
Th@@ ese organ@@ is@@ ms can be t@@ ot@@ ally des@@ ic@@ c@@ ated ;
they can live in a v@@ ac@@ u@@ um .
I am ab@@ sol@@ ut@@ ely cer@@ ta@@ in that life can ex@@ ist in ou@@ ter sp@@ ace , m@@ ove around , find a new a@@ qu@@ e@@ ous en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
In fact , N@@ A@@ S@@ A has sh@@ own a lot of this is out there .
H@@ ere &apos;s an act@@ u@@ al mic@@ r@@ og@@ rap@@ h of the mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le we buil@@ t using these proc@@ ess@@ es , actually just using ye@@ ast me@@ chan@@ is@@ ms with the right design of the pi@@ ec@@ es we put them in ;
ye@@ ast p@@ ut@@ s them together aut@@ om@@ at@@ ically .
This is not an el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on mic@@ r@@ og@@ rap@@ h ; this is just a reg@@ ular ph@@ ot@@ om@@ ic@@ r@@ og@@ rap@@ h .
It &apos;s su@@ ch a l@@ ar@@ ge mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le we can see it with a light mic@@ ros@@ c@@ ope .
Th@@ ese are pic@@ tu@@ res over about a si@@ x@@ -@@ secon@@ d peri@@ o@@ d .
So , this is the pu@@ bl@@ ic@@ ation we had just a sh@@ or@@ t wh@@ ile ago .
This is over 5@@ 8@@ 0@@ ,000 l@@ et@@ ter@@ s of gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e ;
it &apos;s the l@@ arg@@ est mol@@ ec@@ u@@ le ever made by hum@@ ans of a defin@@ ed str@@ uc@@ ture .
It &apos;s over 3@@ 00 million mol@@ ec@@ ular we@@ ight .
If we pr@@ int@@ ed it out at a 10 fon@@ t with no sp@@ ac@@ ing , it ta@@ kes 1@@ 4@@ 2 pag@@ es just to pr@@ int this gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e .
Well , how do we b@@ oo@@ t up a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome ? How do we act@@ iv@@ ate this ?
O@@ b@@ vi@@ ous@@ ly , with a vir@@ us it &apos;s pret@@ ty sim@@ ple ;
it &apos;s much more compl@@ ic@@ ated de@@ al@@ ing with b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia .
It &apos;s also sim@@ pl@@ er when you go into e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es like our@@ selves : you can just po@@ p out the n@@ uc@@ le@@ us and po@@ p in another one , and that &apos;s what you &apos;ve all hear@@ d about with cl@@ on@@ ing .
W@@ it@@ h b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia and Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ ea , the ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome is in@@ te@@ gr@@ ated into the c@@ ell , but we rec@@ ent@@ ly sh@@ ow@@ ed that we can do a comp@@ le@@ te trans@@ pl@@ ant of a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome from one c@@ ell to another and act@@ iv@@ ate it .
We p@@ ur@@ if@@ i@@ ed a ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome from one mic@@ ro@@ bi@@ al spec@@ ies --
r@@ oug@@ h@@ ly , these two are as dist@@ ant as human and m@@ ice --
we ad@@ ded a few ex@@ tra gen@@ es so we could sel@@ ect for this ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome ,
we dig@@ est@@ ed it with enz@@ y@@ m@@ es to k@@ ill all the prot@@ e@@ ins ,
and it was pret@@ ty st@@ un@@ ning when we put this in the c@@ ell -- and you &apos;ll ap@@ pre@@ ci@@ ate our very s@@ op@@ h@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated gr@@ ap@@ h@@ ics here . The new ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome went into the c@@ ell .
In fact , we thought this might be as far as it went , but we tri@@ ed to design the proc@@ ess a little bit f@@ ur@@ ther .
This is a ma@@ j@@ or me@@ chan@@ ism of evol@@ ution right here .
We find all k@@ in@@ ds of spec@@ ies that have ta@@ k@@ en up a secon@@ d ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome or a th@@ ir@@ d one from some@@ where , ad@@ ding th@@ ous@@ ands of new tra@@ its in a secon@@ d to that spec@@ ies .
So , people who think of evol@@ ution as just one gen@@ e chang@@ ing at a time have mis@@ s@@ ed much of bi@@ olog@@ y .
There are enz@@ y@@ m@@ es called res@@ tr@@ ic@@ tion enz@@ y@@ m@@ es that actually dig@@ est D@@ N@@ A .
The ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome that was in the c@@ ell doesn &apos;t have one ;
the ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome we put in does .
It got ex@@ press@@ ed and it rec@@ ogn@@ ized the other ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome as for@@ e@@ ig@@ n materi@@ al , ch@@ e@@ w@@ ed it up , and so we en@@ ded up just with a c@@ ell with the new ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ ome .
It tur@@ ned bl@@ ue because of the gen@@ es we put in it .
And with a very sh@@ or@@ t peri@@ o@@ d of time , all the ch@@ ar@@ ac@@ ter@@ ist@@ ics of one spec@@ ies were l@@ os@@ t and it con@@ ver@@ ted t@@ ot@@ ally into the new spec@@ ies bas@@ ed on the new so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we put in the c@@ ell .
Al@@ l the prot@@ e@@ ins chang@@ ed , the mem@@ br@@ an@@ es chang@@ ed ; when we re@@ ad the gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e , it &apos;s ex@@ act@@ ly what we had trans@@ fer@@ red in .
So , this may s@@ ound like gen@@ om@@ ic al@@ ch@@ em@@ y , but we can , by mov@@ ing the so@@ f@@ tw@@ are of D@@ N@@ A around , change things qu@@ ite dr@@ am@@ at@@ ically .
Now I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed , this is not gen@@ es@@ is ; this is buil@@ ding on three and a h@@ al@@ f bil@@ lion years of evol@@ ution . And I &apos;ve ar@@ gu@@ ed that we &apos;re about to per@@ hap@@ s create a new ver@@ sion of the C@@ amb@@ ri@@ an expl@@ os@@ ion , where there &apos;s m@@ ass@@ ive new spec@@ i@@ ation bas@@ ed on this dig@@ it@@ al design .
Wh@@ y do this ?
I think this is pret@@ ty ob@@ vi@@ ous in ter@@ ms of some of the ne@@ ed@@ s .
We &apos;re about to go from si@@ x and a h@@ al@@ f to n@@ ine bil@@ lion people over the next 4@@ 0 years .
T@@ o put it in cont@@ ex@@ t for my@@ self : I was bor@@ n in 19@@ 4@@ 6 .
There are now three people on the plan@@ et for every one of us that ex@@ ist@@ ed in 19@@ 4@@ 6 ; with@@ in 4@@ 0 years , there &apos;ll be four .
We have tr@@ ou@@ ble fe@@ ed@@ ing , prov@@ id@@ ing fr@@ es@@ h , c@@ le@@ an water , med@@ ic@@ in@@ es , fu@@ el for the si@@ x and a h@@ al@@ f bil@@ lion .
It &apos;s going to be a str@@ et@@ ch to do it for n@@ ine .
We use over f@@ ive bil@@ lion t@@ ons of co@@ al , 30 bil@@ li@@ on@@ -@@ pl@@ us bar@@ rel@@ s of o@@ il --
that &apos;s a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d million bar@@ rel@@ s a day .
When we try to think of bi@@ olog@@ ical proc@@ ess@@ es or any proc@@ ess to re@@ place that , it &apos;s going to be a h@@ u@@ ge ch@@ all@@ en@@ ge .
Th@@ en of course , there &apos;s all that C@@ O@@ 2 from this materi@@ al that end@@ s up in the at@@ mos@@ p@@ here .
We now , from our disc@@ over@@ y around the world , have a d@@ at@@ ab@@ ase with about 20 million gen@@ es , and I like to think of these as the design comp@@ on@@ ents of the fut@@ ure .
The el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics ind@@ us@@ try only had a do@@ z@@ en or so comp@@ on@@ ents , and look at the diver@@ s@@ ity that came out of that .
We &apos;re lim@@ ited here prim@@ ar@@ ily by a bi@@ olog@@ ical real@@ ity and our imag@@ in@@ ation .
We now have tech@@ ni@@ qu@@ es , because of these rap@@ id me@@ th@@ od@@ s of sy@@ n@@ th@@ es@@ is , to do what we &apos;re call@@ ing com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ ial gen@@ om@@ ics .
We have the abil@@ ity now to buil@@ d a l@@ ar@@ ge rob@@ ot that can make a million ch@@ r@@ om@@ os@@ om@@ es a day .
When you think of proc@@ ess@@ ing these 20 million different gen@@ es or trying to op@@ tim@@ ize proc@@ ess@@ es to pro@@ du@@ ce oc@@ t@@ ane or to pro@@ du@@ ce ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ e@@ ut@@ ic@@ als , new v@@ acc@@ in@@ es , we can just with a sm@@ all te@@ am , do more mol@@ ec@@ ular bi@@ olog@@ y than the last 20 years of all sci@@ ence .
And it &apos;s just st@@ and@@ ard sel@@ ect@@ ion :
we can sel@@ ect for vi@@ abil@@ ity , ch@@ em@@ ical or fu@@ el produc@@ tion , v@@ acc@@ ine produc@@ tion , et@@ c .
This is a sc@@ re@@ en s@@ n@@ ap@@ sh@@ ot of some tru@@ e design so@@ f@@ tw@@ are that we &apos;re working on to actually be able to s@@ it down and design spec@@ ies in the computer .
You know , we don &apos;t know nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily what it &apos;ll look like :
we know ex@@ act@@ ly what their gen@@ et@@ ic c@@ od@@ e loo@@ ks like .
We &apos;re f@@ oc@@ using on now f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s .
You &apos;ve se@@ en rec@@ ent@@ ly , cor@@ n to e@@ th@@ an@@ ol is just a b@@ ad ex@@ per@@ im@@ ent .
We have secon@@ d@@ - and th@@ ir@@ d@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s that will be com@@ ing out rel@@ at@@ iv@@ ely so@@ on that are su@@ g@@ ar , to much h@@ igh@@ er@@ -@@ val@@ ue fu@@ el@@ s like oc@@ t@@ ane or different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of b@@ ut@@ an@@ ol .
But the only way we think that bi@@ olog@@ y can have a ma@@ j@@ or imp@@ act with@@ out f@@ ur@@ ther incre@@ as@@ ing the cos@@ t of f@@ ood and lim@@ it@@ ing its av@@ a@@ il@@ abil@@ ity is if we start with C@@ O@@ 2 as its fe@@ ed@@ st@@ oc@@ k , and so we &apos;re working with desig@@ ning cell@@ s to go down this ro@@ ad . And we think we &apos;ll have the first f@@ our@@ th@@ -@@ gener@@ ation fu@@ el@@ s in about 1@@ 8 mon@@ th@@ s .
S@@ un@@ light and C@@ O@@ 2 is one me@@ th@@ o@@ d ... but in our disc@@ over@@ y around the world , we have all k@@ in@@ ds of other me@@ th@@ od@@ s .
This is an organ@@ ism we des@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed in 19@@ 9@@ 6 .
It li@@ ves in the de@@ ep oce@@ an , about a m@@ ile and a h@@ al@@ f de@@ ep , al@@ most at bo@@ il@@ ing@@ -@@ water tem@@ per@@ at@@ u@@ res .
It ta@@ kes C@@ O@@ 2 to me@@ th@@ ane using mol@@ ec@@ ular h@@ y@@ dr@@ og@@ en as its energ@@ y s@@ our@@ ce .
We &apos;re looking to see if we can take cap@@ tu@@ red C@@ O@@ 2 , which can e@@ as@@ ily be pi@@ p@@ ed to s@@ it@@ es , con@@ ver@@ t that C@@ O@@ 2 back into fu@@ el to dr@@ ive this proc@@ ess .
So , in a sh@@ or@@ t peri@@ o@@ d of time , we think that we might be able to incre@@ ase what the bas@@ ic question is of &quot; What is life ? &quot; We tru@@ ly , you know , have mo@@ des@@ t go@@ als of re@@ pl@@ ac@@ ing the whole pe@@ tr@@ ol@@ -@@ ch@@ em@@ ical ind@@ us@@ try --
Y@@ e@@ ah . If you can &apos;t do that at TED , where can you ? --
bec@@ ome a ma@@ j@@ or s@@ our@@ ce of energ@@ y ...
But also , we &apos;re now working on using these same to@@ ol@@ s to come up with inst@@ ant s@@ ets of v@@ acc@@ in@@ es .
You &apos;ve se@@ en this year with fl@@ u ; we &apos;re always a year be@@ h@@ ind and a doll@@ ar sh@@ or@@ t when it com@@ es to the right v@@ acc@@ ine .
I think that can be chang@@ ed by buil@@ ding com@@ b@@ in@@ at@@ or@@ ial v@@ acc@@ in@@ es in ad@@ v@@ ance .
H@@ ere &apos;s what the fut@@ ure may beg@@ in to look like with chang@@ ing , now , the evol@@ ut@@ ion@@ ary tre@@ e , spe@@ ed@@ ing up evol@@ ution with sy@@ n@@ th@@ et@@ ic b@@ ac@@ ter@@ ia , Ar@@ ch@@ a@@ ea and , ev@@ ent@@ ually , e@@ u@@ k@@ ar@@ y@@ ot@@ es .
We &apos;re a ways away from im@@ prov@@ ing people :
our go@@ al is just to make s@@ ure that we have a chan@@ ce to sur@@ v@@ ive long en@@ ough to ma@@ y@@ be do that . Thank you very much .
What I &apos;m going to show you first , as qu@@ ick@@ ly as I can , is some f@@ oun@@ d@@ at@@ ional work , some new technology that we br@@ ought to M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t as part of an acqu@@ is@@ ition al@@ most ex@@ act@@ ly a year ago . This is S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on , and it &apos;s an en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment
in which you can e@@ i@@ ther loc@@ ally or rem@@ ot@@ ely inter@@ act with v@@ ast am@@ oun@@ ts of vis@@ u@@ al data .
We &apos;re looking at many , many g@@ ig@@ ab@@ y@@ t@@ es of dig@@ it@@ al ph@@ ot@@ os here and kind of se@@ am@@ l@@ ess@@ ly and continu@@ ous@@ ly z@@ o@@ om@@ ing in , p@@ an@@ ning through it , re@@ ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ing it in any way we want .
And it doesn &apos;t m@@ att@@ er how much inform@@ ation we &apos;re looking at , how big these coll@@ ect@@ ions are or how big the imag@@ es are .
M@@ os@@ t of them are ordin@@ ary dig@@ it@@ al cam@@ era ph@@ ot@@ os , but this one , for example , is a sc@@ an from the L@@ i@@ br@@ ary of Con@@ gr@@ ess , and it &apos;s in the 3@@ 00 me@@ g@@ ap@@ i@@ x@@ el ran@@ ge .
It doesn &apos;t make any differ@@ ence because the only thing that ought to lim@@ it the per@@ for@@ man@@ ce of a system like this one is the num@@ ber of pi@@ x@@ el@@ s on your sc@@ re@@ en at any giv@@ en mom@@ ent . It &apos;s also very f@@ le@@ x@@ i@@ ble arch@@ it@@ ect@@ ure .
This is an ent@@ ire b@@ ook , so this is an example of non@@ -@@ im@@ age data .
This is &quot; B@@ le@@ ak H@@ ou@@ se &quot; by D@@ ick@@ en@@ s . E@@ very col@@ um@@ n is a ch@@ ap@@ ter .
T@@ o pr@@ ove to you that it &apos;s really t@@ ex@@ t , and not an im@@ age , we can do something like so , to really show that this is a real re@@ present@@ ation of the t@@ ex@@ t ; it &apos;s not a pic@@ ture .
M@@ ay@@ be this is an art@@ if@@ ici@@ al way to re@@ ad an e-@@ b@@ ook .
I w@@ ouldn &apos;t re@@ com@@ men@@ d it .
This is a more real@@ ist@@ ic case , an is@@ sue of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
E@@ very l@@ ar@@ ge im@@ age is the beg@@ in@@ ning of a s@@ ect@@ ion .
And this really giv@@ es you the jo@@ y and the good experi@@ ence of read@@ ing the real p@@ ap@@ er ver@@ sion of a mag@@ az@@ ine or a ne@@ w@@ sp@@ ap@@ er , which is an in@@ h@@ er@@ ent@@ ly m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ sc@@ ale kind of me@@ di@@ um .
We &apos;ve done something with the cor@@ ner of this partic@@ ular is@@ sue of The G@@ u@@ ar@@ di@@ an .
We &apos;ve made up a fa@@ ke ad that &apos;s very h@@ ig@@ h res@@ ol@@ ution -- much h@@ ig@@ her than in an ordin@@ ary ad -- and we &apos;ve em@@ b@@ ed@@ ded ex@@ tra cont@@ ent .
If you want to see the fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of this c@@ ar , you can see it here .
O@@ r other model@@ s , or even tech@@ n@@ ical spec@@ ific@@ ations .
And this really g@@ ets at some of these ide@@ as about really doing away with those lim@@ its on sc@@ re@@ en real est@@ ate .
We h@@ ope that this me@@ ans no more pop@@ -@@ up@@ s and other r@@ ub@@ bis@@ h like that -- sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be nec@@ ess@@ ary .
O@@ f course , m@@ app@@ ing is one of those ob@@ vi@@ ous ap@@ plic@@ ations for a technology like this .
And this one I really w@@ on &apos;t sp@@ end any time on , ex@@ ce@@ pt to say that we have things to contr@@ i@@ bu@@ te to this fi@@ el@@ d as well .
But those are all the ro@@ ad@@ s in the U@@ .@@ S@@ . super@@ im@@ pos@@ ed on to@@ p of a N@@ A@@ S@@ A ge@@ os@@ pat@@ ial im@@ age .
So let &apos;s p@@ ul@@ l up , now , something el@@ se .
This is actually live on the W@@ e@@ b now ; you can go ch@@ ec@@ k it out .
This is a pro@@ ject called P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th , which mar@@ ri@@ es two different technolog@@ ies .
O@@ ne of them is S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on and the other is some very be@@ aut@@ if@@ u@@ l comput@@ er@@ -@@ vis@@ ion res@@ ear@@ ch done by N@@ o@@ ah S@@ n@@ av@@ ely , a gr@@ ad@@ u@@ ate stud@@ ent at the Un@@ iver@@ s@@ ity of W@@ as@@ h@@ ing@@ t@@ on , co@@ -@@ ad@@ vis@@ ed by St@@ eve S@@ e@@ it@@ z at U@@ .@@ W@@ . and R@@ ic@@ k S@@ z@@ el@@ is@@ k@@ i at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t R@@ es@@ ear@@ ch . A very n@@ ice coll@@ abor@@ ation .
And so this is live on the W@@ e@@ b . It &apos;s pow@@ er@@ ed by S@@ e@@ ad@@ rag@@ on .
You can see that when we do these sor@@ ts of vi@@ e@@ w@@ s , where we can di@@ ve through imag@@ es and have this kind of m@@ ul@@ ti@@ -@@ res@@ ol@@ ution experi@@ ence .
But the sp@@ at@@ ial ar@@ ran@@ g@@ ement of the imag@@ es here is actually me@@ an@@ ing@@ ful .
The computer vis@@ ion al@@ g@@ or@@ i@@ th@@ ms have re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed these imag@@ es together so that they cor@@ respon@@ d to the real sp@@ ace in which these sh@@ ots -- all ta@@ k@@ en ne@@ ar Gr@@ as@@ si L@@ a@@ kes in the C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an R@@ oc@@ k@@ ies -- all these sh@@ ots were ta@@ k@@ en . So you see el@@ em@@ ents here of st@@ ab@@ ili@@ z@@ ed s@@ li@@ de@@ -@@ show or p@@ an@@ or@@ am@@ ic imag@@ ing , and these things have all been rel@@ ated sp@@ at@@ i@@ ally .
I &apos;m not s@@ ure if I have time to show you any other en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents .
S@@ ome are much more sp@@ at@@ ial .
I would like to j@@ um@@ p str@@ a@@ ight to one of N@@ o@@ ah &apos;s or@@ ig@@ in@@ al d@@ at@@ a@@ -@@ s@@ ets -- this is from an ear@@ ly prot@@ ot@@ y@@ p@@ e that we first got working this sum@@ m@@ er -- to show you what I think is really the pun@@ ch line be@@ h@@ ind the P@@ h@@ ot@@ os@@ y@@ n@@ th technology , It &apos;s not nec@@ ess@@ ar@@ ily so ap@@ par@@ ent from looking at the en@@ vir@@ on@@ m@@ ents we &apos;ve put up on the w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite .
We had to wor@@ r@@ y about the l@@ aw@@ y@@ ers and so on .
This is a re@@ con@@ str@@ uc@@ tion of N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al that was done ent@@ ir@@ ely comput@@ at@@ ion@@ ally from imag@@ es sc@@ rap@@ ed from F@@ l@@ ick@@ r . You just t@@ y@@ p@@ e N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame into F@@ l@@ ick@@ r , and you get some pic@@ tu@@ res of gu@@ y@@ s in T@@ -@@ sh@@ ir@@ ts , and of the cam@@ p@@ us and so on . And each of these or@@ an@@ ge con@@ es re@@ pres@@ ents an im@@ age that was disc@@ over@@ ed to bel@@ ong to this mo@@ del .
And so these are all F@@ l@@ ick@@ r imag@@ es , and they &apos;ve all been rel@@ ated sp@@ at@@ i@@ ally in this way .
We can just n@@ av@@ ig@@ ate in this very sim@@ ple way .
You know , I never thought that I &apos;d end up working at M@@ ic@@ ros@@ of@@ t .
It &apos;s very gr@@ at@@ if@@ ying to have this kind of rec@@ ep@@ tion here .
I gu@@ ess you can see this is l@@ ots of different t@@ y@@ p@@ es of cam@@ er@@ as : it &apos;s every@@ thing from cell@@ -@@ ph@@ one cam@@ er@@ as to prof@@ ess@@ ional S@@ L@@ R@@ s , qu@@ ite a l@@ ar@@ ge num@@ ber of them , st@@ it@@ ch@@ ed together in this en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
If I can find some of the sort of we@@ ir@@ d ones --
So many of them are oc@@ cl@@ u@@ ded by fac@@ es , and so on .
S@@ om@@ e@@ where in here there is actually a ser@@ ies of ph@@ otog@@ rap@@ h@@ s -- here we go .
This is actually a pos@@ ter of N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame that re@@ gi@@ st@@ er@@ ed cor@@ rec@@ t@@ ly .
We can di@@ ve in from the pos@@ ter to a ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical vi@@ e@@ w of this en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment .
What the point here really is is that we can do things with the social en@@ vir@@ on@@ ment . This is now ta@@ king data from every@@ body -- from the ent@@ ire coll@@ ect@@ ive mem@@ ory , vis@@ ually , of what the E@@ art@@ h loo@@ ks like -- and lin@@ k all of that together .
Th@@ ose ph@@ ot@@ os bec@@ ome lin@@ ked , and they make something em@@ erg@@ ent that &apos;s gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the part@@ s .
You have a mo@@ del that em@@ erg@@ es of the ent@@ ire E@@ art@@ h .
Th@@ in@@ k of this as the long ta@@ il to S@@ te@@ ph@@ en L@@ aw@@ l@@ er &apos;s V@@ ir@@ tu@@ al E@@ art@@ h work .
And this is something that gr@@ ows in comp@@ le@@ x@@ ity as people use it , and wh@@ ose ben@@ ef@@ its bec@@ ome gre@@ ater to the us@@ ers as they use it .
Th@@ e@@ ir own ph@@ ot@@ os are gett@@ ing t@@ agg@@ ed with met@@ a@@ -@@ data that som@@ eb@@ ody el@@ se ent@@ er@@ ed .
If som@@ eb@@ ody bo@@ ther@@ ed to ta@@ g all of these sa@@ int@@ s and say who they all are , then my ph@@ oto of N@@ o@@ tr@@ e D@@ ame C@@ a@@ the@@ dr@@ al su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly g@@ ets en@@ ri@@ ch@@ ed with all of that data , and I can use it as an entr@@ y point to di@@ ve into that sp@@ ace , into that met@@ a@@ -@@ ver@@ se , using every@@ body el@@ se &apos;s ph@@ ot@@ os , and do a kind of a cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ mo@@ dal and cr@@ os@@ s@@ -@@ us@@ er social experi@@ ence that way .
And of course , a b@@ y@@ -@@ produc@@ t of all of that is im@@ men@@ sel@@ y ric@@ h vir@@ tu@@ al model@@ s of every interest@@ ing part of the E@@ art@@ h , coll@@ ected not just from over@@ he@@ ad f@@ lig@@ h@@ ts and from s@@ at@@ ell@@ ite imag@@ es and so on , but from the coll@@ ect@@ ive mem@@ ory .
Thank you so much .
Ch@@ r@@ is An@@ der@@ son : D@@ o I understand this right ? What your so@@ f@@ tw@@ are is going to all@@ ow , is that at some point , really with@@ in the next few years , all the pic@@ tu@@ res that are sh@@ ar@@ ed by any@@ one ac@@ ros@@ s the world are going to lin@@ k together ?
B@@ A@@ A : Y@@ es . What this is really doing is disc@@ over@@ ing ,
cre@@ ating h@@ y@@ per@@ lin@@ ks , if you will , between imag@@ es .
It &apos;s doing that bas@@ ed on the cont@@ ent in@@ side the imag@@ es .
And that g@@ ets really ex@@ cit@@ ing when you think about the ri@@ ch@@ ness of the sem@@ ant@@ ic inform@@ ation a lot of imag@@ es have .
L@@ i@@ ke when you do a we@@ b se@@ ar@@ ch for imag@@ es , you t@@ y@@ p@@ e in ph@@ r@@ as@@ es , and the t@@ ex@@ t on the we@@ b p@@ age is car@@ r@@ ying a lot of inform@@ ation about what that pic@@ ture is of .
What if that pic@@ ture lin@@ ks to all of your pic@@ tu@@ res ?
The am@@ oun@@ t of sem@@ ant@@ ic inter@@ conn@@ ect@@ ion and ri@@ ch@@ ness that com@@ es out of that is really h@@ u@@ ge .
It &apos;s a cl@@ as@@ si@@ c n@@ et@@ work eff@@ ect .
C@@ A : T@@ r@@ u@@ ly incredi@@ ble . Con@@ gr@@ at@@ ul@@ ations .
You know , one of the int@@ en@@ se p@@ le@@ as@@ u@@ res of tr@@ av@@ el and one of the del@@ igh@@ ts of e@@ th@@ n@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ic res@@ ear@@ ch is the opport@@ un@@ ity to live am@@ ong@@ st those who have not for@@ g@@ ott@@ en the old ways , who still feel their p@@ ast in the w@@ ind , t@@ ou@@ ch it in st@@ ones pol@@ is@@ h@@ ed by ra@@ in , ta@@ st@@ e it in the b@@ itt@@ er le@@ av@@ es of pl@@ ant@@ s .
J@@ ust to know that J@@ ag@@ u@@ ar sh@@ am@@ ans still j@@ our@@ ne@@ y be@@ y@@ on@@ d the M@@ il@@ k@@ y W@@ ay , or the my@@ th@@ s of the In@@ u@@ it el@@ d@@ ers still res@@ on@@ ate with me@@ an@@ ing , or that in the H@@ im@@ al@@ ay@@ a , the B@@ ud@@ d@@ h@@ ists still p@@ ur@@ sue the bre@@ at@@ h of the D@@ h@@ ar@@ ma , is to really rem@@ em@@ ber the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ thr@@ op@@ olog@@ y , and that is the idea that the world in which we live does not ex@@ ist in some ab@@ sol@@ ute sen@@ se , but is just one mo@@ del of real@@ ity ,
the con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of one partic@@ ular se@@ t of ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ive ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es that our lin@@ e@@ age made , al@@ be@@ it succ@@ ess@@ f@@ ul@@ ly , many gener@@ ations ago .
And of course , we all sh@@ are the same ad@@ ap@@ t@@ ive im@@ per@@ at@@ iv@@ es .
We &apos;re all bor@@ n . We all br@@ ing our children into the world .
We go through in@@ it@@ i@@ ation rit@@ es .
We have to de@@ al with the in@@ ex@@ or@@ able se@@ par@@ ation of de@@ at@@ h , so it sh@@ ouldn &apos;t sur@@ pr@@ ise us that we all s@@ ing , we all d@@ ance ,
we all have art .
But what &apos;s interest@@ ing is the un@@ i@@ que c@@ ad@@ ence of the s@@ ong , the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance in every cult@@ ure .
And wh@@ ether it is the P@@ en@@ an in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o , or the V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in H@@ a@@ iti , or the w@@ ar@@ ri@@ ors in the K@@ a@@ is@@ ut des@@ er@@ t of N@@ or@@ ther@@ n K@@ en@@ y@@ a , the C@@ ur@@ and@@ ero in the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of the An@@ de@@ s , or a car@@ av@@ an@@ ser@@ ai in the m@@ id@@ d@@ le of the S@@ a@@ h@@ ar@@ a --
this is inci@@ d@@ ent@@ ally the f@@ ell@@ ow that I tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed into the des@@ er@@ t with a mon@@ th ago -- or in@@ de@@ ed a y@@ ak h@@ er@@ der in the sl@@ op@@ es of Q@@ om@@ ol@@ ang@@ ma , E@@ ver@@ est , the go@@ d@@ d@@ ess mo@@ ther of the world .
Al@@ l of these pe@@ op@@ les te@@ ach us that there are other ways of being , other ways of thinking , other ways of or@@ i@@ ent@@ ing y@@ our@@ self in the E@@ art@@ h .
And this is an idea , if you think about it , can only f@@ ill you with h@@ ope .
Now , together the my@@ ri@@ ad cult@@ u@@ res of the world make up a we@@ b of spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al life and cult@@ ur@@ al life that en@@ vel@@ op@@ s the plan@@ et , and is as important to the w@@ ell@@ -@@ being of the plan@@ et as in@@ de@@ ed is the bi@@ olog@@ ical we@@ b of life that you know as a bi@@ os@@ p@@ here .
And you might think of this cult@@ ur@@ al we@@ b of life as being an e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here , and you might de@@ fine the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here as being the su@@ m t@@ ot@@ al of all th@@ oug@@ h@@ ts and dre@@ am@@ s , my@@ th@@ s , ide@@ as , in@@ spi@@ r@@ ations , int@@ u@@ it@@ ions br@@ ought into being by the human imag@@ in@@ ation sin@@ ce the d@@ aw@@ n of con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
The e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here is hum@@ an@@ ity &apos;s great leg@@ ac@@ y .
It &apos;s the sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of all that we are and all that we can be as an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing@@ ly in@@ qu@@ is@@ it@@ ive spec@@ ies .
And just as the bi@@ os@@ p@@ here has been s@@ ever@@ ely er@@ o@@ ded , so too is the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here -- and , if any@@ thing , at a far gre@@ ater r@@ ate .
No bi@@ olog@@ ists , for example , would d@@ are su@@ gg@@ est that 50 percent of all spec@@ ies or more have been or are on the br@@ in@@ k of ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion because it sim@@ p@@ ly is not tru@@ e , and y@@ et that -- the most ap@@ oc@@ al@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ ic sc@@ en@@ ario in the real@@ m of bi@@ olog@@ ical diver@@ s@@ ity -- sc@@ ar@@ c@@ ely ap@@ pro@@ ach@@ es what we know to be the most op@@ tim@@ ist@@ ic sc@@ en@@ ario in the real@@ m of cult@@ ur@@ al diver@@ s@@ ity .
And the great in@@ dic@@ at@@ or of that , of course , is lan@@ gu@@ age l@@ os@@ s .
When each of you in this room were bor@@ n , there were 6@@ ,000 lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es sp@@ o@@ k@@ en on the plan@@ et .
Now , a lan@@ gu@@ age is not just a body of v@@ oc@@ ab@@ ul@@ ary or a se@@ t of gr@@ am@@ mat@@ ical r@@ ul@@ es .
A lan@@ gu@@ age is a fl@@ as@@ h of the human spi@@ r@@ it .
It &apos;s a ve@@ h@@ ic@@ le through which the s@@ ou@@ l of each partic@@ ular cult@@ ure com@@ es into the materi@@ al world .
E@@ very lan@@ gu@@ age is an ol@@ d@@ -@@ gr@@ ow@@ th for@@ est of the min@@ d , a w@@ at@@ er@@ sh@@ ed , a thought , an ec@@ os@@ y@@ stem of spi@@ rit@@ u@@ al possi@@ bil@@ ities .
And of those 6@@ ,000 lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es , as we s@@ it here today in M@@ on@@ ter@@ ey , f@@ ul@@ ly h@@ al@@ f are no l@@ ong@@ er being wh@@ is@@ per@@ ed into the ear@@ s of children .
They &apos;re no l@@ ong@@ er being ta@@ ug@@ ht to b@@ ab@@ ies , which me@@ ans , eff@@ ect@@ iv@@ ely , un@@ less something chang@@ es , they &apos;re al@@ read@@ y de@@ ad .
What could be more l@@ on@@ ely than to be en@@ vel@@ op@@ ed in s@@ il@@ ence , to be the last of your people to spe@@ ak your lan@@ gu@@ age , to have no way to p@@ ass on the w@@ is@@ d@@ om of the anc@@ est@@ ors or ant@@ ici@@ p@@ ate the pr@@ om@@ ise of the children ?
And y@@ et , that dre@@ ad@@ ful f@@ ate is in@@ de@@ ed the p@@ light of som@@ eb@@ ody some@@ where on E@@ art@@ h r@@ oug@@ h@@ ly every two we@@ e@@ ks , because every two we@@ e@@ ks , some el@@ der di@@ es and car@@ ri@@ es with him into the gr@@ ave the last sy@@ l@@ l@@ ab@@ les of an an@@ ci@@ ent t@@ on@@ gu@@ e .
And I know there &apos;s some of you who say , &quot; Well , w@@ ouldn &apos;t it be better ,
w@@ ouldn &apos;t the world be a better place if we all just sp@@ o@@ ke one lan@@ gu@@ age ? &quot; And I say , &quot; G@@ re@@ at , let &apos;s make that lan@@ gu@@ age Y@@ or@@ ub@@ a . L@@ et &apos;s make it C@@ ant@@ on@@ ese .
L@@ et &apos;s make it K@@ og@@ i . &quot;
And you &apos;ll su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly disc@@ over what it would be like to be un@@ able to spe@@ ak your own lan@@ gu@@ age .
And so , what I &apos;d like to do with you today is sort of take you on a j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here ,
a b@@ ri@@ e@@ f j@@ our@@ ne@@ y through the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here , to try to beg@@ in to give you a sen@@ se of what in fact is being l@@ os@@ t .
Now , there are many of us who sort of for@@ get that when I say &quot; different ways of being , &quot; I really do mean different ways of being .
T@@ a@@ ke , for example , this chil@@ d of a B@@ ar@@ as@@ ana in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on , the people of the an@@ ac@@ on@@ da who believe that my@@ th@@ olog@@ ically they came up the mil@@ k riv@@ er from the e@@ ast in the bel@@ ly of s@@ ac@@ red s@@ n@@ a@@ kes .
Now , this is a people who c@@ ogn@@ it@@ iv@@ ely do not dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h the col@@ or bl@@ ue from the col@@ or gre@@ en because the can@@ op@@ y of the he@@ av@@ en@@ s is equ@@ ated to the can@@ op@@ y of the for@@ est up@@ on which the people de@@ pen@@ d .
They have a cur@@ i@@ ous lan@@ gu@@ age and mar@@ ri@@ age r@@ u@@ le which is called &quot; l@@ ing@@ u@@ ist@@ ic ex@@ og@@ am@@ y : &quot; you m@@ ust mar@@ r@@ y some@@ one who spe@@ a@@ ks a different lan@@ gu@@ age .
And this is all ro@@ ot@@ ed in the my@@ th@@ olog@@ ical p@@ ast , y@@ et the cur@@ i@@ ous thing is in these long h@@ ous@@ es , where there are si@@ x or s@@ even lan@@ gu@@ ag@@ es sp@@ o@@ k@@ en because of inter@@ mar@@ ri@@ age , you never he@@ ar any@@ one pr@@ act@@ ic@@ ing a lan@@ gu@@ age .
They sim@@ p@@ ly li@@ st@@ en and then beg@@ in to spe@@ ak .
O@@ r , one of the most f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating tri@@ b@@ es I ever liv@@ ed with , the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani of nor@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n E@@ cu@@ ad@@ or , an ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing people first cont@@ act@@ ed pe@@ ac@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly in 19@@ 5@@ 8 .
In 19@@ 5@@ 7 , f@@ ive mis@@ s@@ ion@@ ar@@ ies att@@ em@@ p@@ ted cont@@ act and made a cr@@ it@@ ical m@@ ist@@ a@@ ke .
They dr@@ op@@ p@@ ed from the air 8 x 10 gl@@ os@@ s@@ y ph@@ otog@@ rap@@ h@@ s of th@@ em@@ selves in what we would say to be fri@@ end@@ ly g@@ est@@ u@@ res , for@@ gett@@ ing that these people of the ra@@ in@@ for@@ est had never se@@ en any@@ thing tw@@ o@@ -@@ di@@ men@@ s@@ ional in their li@@ ves .
They pic@@ ked up these ph@@ otog@@ rap@@ h@@ s from the for@@ est fl@@ o@@ or , tri@@ ed to look be@@ h@@ ind the face to find the form or the fig@@ ure , found no@@ thing , and con@@ cl@@ u@@ ded that these were call@@ ing car@@ ds from the dev@@ il , so they spe@@ ar@@ ed the f@@ ive mis@@ s@@ ion@@ ar@@ ies to de@@ at@@ h .
But the W@@ a@@ or@@ ani didn &apos;t just spe@@ ar out@@ si@@ d@@ ers .
They spe@@ ar@@ ed each other .
5@@ 4 percent of their mor@@ tal@@ ity was due to them spe@@ ar@@ ing each other .
We tr@@ ac@@ ed gen@@ e@@ al@@ og@@ ies back e@@ ight gener@@ ations , and we found two inst@@ an@@ ces of natur@@ al de@@ at@@ h and when we press@@ u@@ red the people a little bit about it , they ad@@ m@@ itt@@ ed that one of the f@@ ell@@ ows had g@@ ott@@ en so old that he di@@ ed gett@@ ing old , so we spe@@ ar@@ ed him any@@ way . But at the same time they had a per@@ sp@@ ic@@ ac@@ i@@ ous know@@ le@@ d@@ ge of the for@@ est that was ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing .
Th@@ e@@ ir h@@ un@@ ter@@ s could sm@@ ell anim@@ al ur@@ ine at 4@@ 0 p@@ ac@@ es and tell you what spec@@ ies le@@ ft it be@@ h@@ ind .
In the ear@@ ly &apos; 8@@ 0@@ s , I had a really ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing as@@ sign@@ ment when I was as@@ ked by my prof@@ ess@@ or at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard if I was interest@@ ed in going down to H@@ a@@ iti , in@@ fil@@ tr@@ ating the sec@@ re@@ t soci@@ et@@ ies which were the f@@ oun@@ d@@ ation of D@@ u@@ val@@ i@@ er &apos;s str@@ eng@@ th and T@@ ont@@ on M@@ ac@@ out@@ es , and sec@@ ur@@ ing the po@@ is@@ on used to make z@@ om@@ bi@@ es .
In ord@@ er to make sen@@ se out of sen@@ s@@ ation , of course , I had to understand something about this re@@ mark@@ able fa@@ it@@ h of V@@ od@@ ou@@ n . And V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is not a bl@@ ack mag@@ ic c@@ ult .
O@@ n the contr@@ ary , it &apos;s a comp@@ le@@ x met@@ ap@@ h@@ y@@ s@@ ical wor@@ l@@ d@@ vi@@ e@@ w .
It &apos;s interest@@ ing .
If I as@@ ked you to n@@ ame the great rel@@ ig@@ ions of the world , what would you say ?
Ch@@ ri@@ st@@ i@@ an@@ ity , I@@ sl@@ am , B@@ ud@@ d@@ h@@ ism , J@@ ud@@ a@@ ism , wh@@ at@@ ever .
There &apos;s always one contin@@ ent le@@ ft out , the as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion being that sub@@ -@@ S@@ a@@ h@@ ar@@ an Africa had no rel@@ ig@@ i@@ ous beli@@ ef@@ s . Well , of course , they did and V@@ oo@@ do@@ o is sim@@ p@@ ly the dist@@ ill@@ ation of these very prof@@ ound rel@@ ig@@ i@@ ous ide@@ as that came over dur@@ ing the tr@@ ag@@ ic D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a of the s@@ lav@@ er@@ y era .
But , what ma@@ kes V@@ oo@@ do@@ o so interest@@ ing is that it &apos;s this liv@@ ing rel@@ at@@ ion@@ shi@@ p between the liv@@ ing and the de@@ ad .
So , the liv@@ ing give bi@@ r@@ th to the spi@@ rit@@ s .
The spi@@ rit@@ s can be inv@@ o@@ ked from ben@@ e@@ at@@ h the G@@ re@@ at W@@ ater , respon@@ ding to the r@@ h@@ y@@ th@@ m of the d@@ ance to mom@@ ent@@ ar@@ ily dis@@ place the s@@ ou@@ l of the liv@@ ing , so that for that b@@ ri@@ e@@ f sh@@ in@@ ing mom@@ ent , the ac@@ ol@@ y@@ te bec@@ om@@ es the go@@ d .
That &apos;s why the V@@ oo@@ d@@ oo@@ ists like to say that &quot; You wh@@ ite people go to ch@@ ur@@ ch and spe@@ ak about Go@@ d .
We d@@ ance in the tem@@ ple and bec@@ ome Go@@ d . &quot;
And because you are pos@@ s@@ ess@@ ed , you are ta@@ k@@ en by the spi@@ r@@ it -- how can you be h@@ ar@@ m@@ ed ?
So you see these ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ations : V@@ oo@@ do@@ o ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es in a state of tr@@ ance h@@ and@@ l@@ ing b@@ ur@@ ning em@@ b@@ ers with im@@ pun@@ ity , a ra@@ ther ast@@ on@@ is@@ h@@ ing de@@ mon@@ str@@ ation of the abil@@ ity of the min@@ d to aff@@ ect the body that be@@ ars it when cat@@ al@@ y@@ z@@ ed in the state of ex@@ tr@@ eme ex@@ cit@@ ation .
Now , of all the pe@@ op@@ les that I &apos;ve ever been with , the most ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary are the K@@ og@@ i of the S@@ i@@ erra N@@ ev@@ ada de S@@ an@@ ta M@@ ar@@ ta in nor@@ ther@@ n C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a .
D@@ es@@ c@@ end@@ ant@@ s of the an@@ ci@@ ent T@@ a@@ ir@@ ona c@@ iv@@ ili@@ z@@ ation which on@@ ce car@@ p@@ et@@ ed the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain of C@@ ol@@ om@@ bi@@ a , in the w@@ a@@ ke of the con@@ ques@@ t , these people re@@ tre@@ ated into an is@@ ol@@ ated vol@@ can@@ ic m@@ as@@ si@@ f that so@@ ars ab@@ ove the C@@ ari@@ b@@ be@@ an co@@ ast@@ al pl@@ ain .
In a bl@@ oo@@ d@@ st@@ ain@@ ed contin@@ ent , these people al@@ one were never con@@ qu@@ er@@ ed by the S@@ p@@ an@@ is@@ h .
T@@ o this day , they re@@ ma@@ in r@@ ul@@ ed by a rit@@ u@@ al pr@@ i@@ es@@ th@@ ood but the tr@@ ain@@ ing for the pr@@ i@@ es@@ th@@ ood is ra@@ ther ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary .
The y@@ oun@@ g ac@@ ol@@ y@@ t@@ es are ta@@ k@@ en away from their fam@@ ili@@ es at the age of three and four , se@@ ques@@ ter@@ ed in a sh@@ ad@@ ow@@ y world of d@@ ar@@ k@@ ness in st@@ one h@@ ut@@ s at the bas@@ e of gl@@ ac@@ i@@ ers for 1@@ 8 years :
two n@@ in@@ e-@@ year peri@@ od@@ s del@@ i@@ ber@@ at@@ ely ch@@ os@@ en to m@@ im@@ ic the n@@ ine mon@@ th@@ s of g@@ est@@ ation they sp@@ end in their natur@@ al mo@@ ther &apos;s wom@@ b ; now they are met@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ically in the wom@@ b of the great mo@@ ther .
And for this ent@@ ire time , they are in@@ cult@@ ur@@ ated into the val@@ u@@ es of their soci@@ et@@ y , val@@ u@@ es that ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the prop@@ os@@ ition that their pr@@ ay@@ ers and their pr@@ ay@@ ers al@@ one ma@@ in@@ ta@@ in the cos@@ m@@ ic -- or we might say the ec@@ olog@@ ical -- b@@ al@@ ance .
And at the end of this am@@ az@@ ing in@@ it@@ i@@ ation , one day they &apos;re su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly ta@@ k@@ en out and for the first time in their li@@ ves , at the age of 1@@ 8 , they see a s@@ un@@ ris@@ e . And in that cr@@ y@@ st@@ al mom@@ ent of aw@@ ar@@ en@@ ess of first light as the S@@ un beg@@ ins to b@@ a@@ the the sl@@ op@@ es of the st@@ un@@ n@@ ing@@ ly be@@ aut@@ if@@ u@@ l l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , su@@ d@@ d@@ en@@ ly every@@ thing they have lear@@ ned in the ab@@ str@@ act is aff@@ ir@@ m@@ ed in st@@ un@@ ning gl@@ ory . And the pr@@ i@@ est ste@@ ps back
and s@@ ays , &quot; You see ? It &apos;s really as I &apos;ve t@@ old you .
It is that be@@ aut@@ if@@ u@@ l . It is y@@ our@@ s to prot@@ ect . &quot;
They call th@@ em@@ selves the &quot; el@@ der br@@ o@@ th@@ ers &quot; and they say we , who are the y@@ oun@@ g@@ er br@@ o@@ th@@ ers , are the ones respon@@ si@@ ble for des@@ tr@@ o@@ ying the world .
Now , this l@@ ev@@ el of int@@ u@@ ition bec@@ om@@ es very important .
Wh@@ en@@ ever we think of indi@@ gen@@ ous people and l@@ and@@ sc@@ ap@@ e , we e@@ i@@ ther inv@@ o@@ ke R@@ ous@@ se@@ a@@ u and the old can@@ ard of the &quot; no@@ ble s@@ av@@ age , &quot; which is an idea rac@@ ist in its sim@@ plic@@ ity , or al@@ ter@@ nat@@ iv@@ ely , we inv@@ o@@ ke Th@@ or@@ e@@ a@@ u and say these people are cl@@ os@@ er to the E@@ art@@ h than we are .
Well , indi@@ gen@@ ous people are ne@@ i@@ ther sent@@ im@@ ent@@ al n@@ or we@@ ak@@ en@@ ed by n@@ ost@@ al@@ g@@ ia .
There &apos;s not a lot of room for e@@ i@@ ther in the mal@@ ari@@ al s@@ w@@ am@@ ps of the A@@ sm@@ at or in the ch@@ ill@@ ing w@@ in@@ ds of T@@ i@@ be@@ t , but they have , n@@ ever@@ th@@ el@@ ess , through time and rit@@ u@@ al , for@@ g@@ ed a tr@@ ad@@ it@@ ional my@@ st@@ i@@ que of the E@@ art@@ h that is bas@@ ed not on the idea of being sel@@ f@@ -@@ con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ly cl@@ ose to it , but on a far sub@@ t@@ l@@ er int@@ u@@ ition : the idea that the E@@ art@@ h it@@ self can only ex@@ ist because it is bre@@ a@@ th@@ ed into being by human con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness .
Now , what does that mean ?
It me@@ ans that a y@@ oun@@ g k@@ id from the An@@ de@@ s who &apos;s ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that that m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in is an A@@ p@@ u spi@@ r@@ it that will di@@ rec@@ t his or her d@@ est@@ in@@ y will be a prof@@ oun@@ d@@ ly different human being and have a different rel@@ at@@ ion@@ shi@@ p to that res@@ our@@ ce or that place than a y@@ oun@@ g k@@ id from M@@ ont@@ ana ra@@ is@@ ed to believe that a m@@ oun@@ ta@@ in is a pi@@ le of r@@ oc@@ k read@@ y to be min@@ ed .
Wh@@ ether it &apos;s the ab@@ od@@ e of a spi@@ r@@ it or a pi@@ le of ore is ir@@ rel@@ ev@@ ant .
What &apos;s interest@@ ing is the met@@ ap@@ h@@ or that defin@@ es the rel@@ at@@ ion@@ shi@@ p between the individu@@ al and the natur@@ al world .
I was ra@@ is@@ ed in the for@@ est@@ s of B@@ rit@@ is@@ h C@@ ol@@ um@@ bi@@ a to believe those for@@ est@@ s ex@@ ist@@ ed to be c@@ ut .
That made me a different human being than my fri@@ end@@ s am@@ ong@@ st the K@@ w@@ ag@@ i@@ ul@@ th who believe that those for@@ est@@ s were the ab@@ od@@ e of H@@ u@@ x@@ wh@@ u@@ k@@ w and the C@@ r@@ oo@@ ked Be@@ ak of H@@ e@@ av@@ en and the can@@ ni@@ b@@ al spi@@ rit@@ s that d@@ w@@ ell@@ ed at the nor@@ th end of the world , spi@@ rit@@ s they would have to eng@@ age dur@@ ing their H@@ am@@ at@@ sa in@@ it@@ i@@ ation .
Now , if you beg@@ in to look at the idea that these cult@@ u@@ res could create different real@@ ities , you could beg@@ in to understand some of their ex@@ tra@@ ordin@@ ary disc@@ over@@ ies . T@@ a@@ ke this pl@@ ant here .
It &apos;s a ph@@ otog@@ rap@@ h I t@@ ook in the N@@ or@@ th@@ w@@ est A@@ ma@@ z@@ on just last A@@ pr@@ il .
This is ay@@ a@@ h@@ u@@ as@@ ca , which many of you have hear@@ d about , the most pow@@ er@@ ful p@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ act@@ ive pre@@ par@@ ation of the sh@@ am@@ an &apos;s re@@ per@@ to@@ ire .
What ma@@ kes ay@@ a@@ h@@ u@@ as@@ ca f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating is not the sh@@ e@@ er ph@@ ar@@ mac@@ olog@@ ical pot@@ ent@@ ial of this pre@@ par@@ ation , but the el@@ abor@@ ation of it . It &apos;s made really of two different s@@ our@@ ces :
on the one h@@ and , this w@@ oo@@ d@@ y li@@ ana which has in it a ser@@ ies of bet@@ a@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es , h@@ ar@@ m@@ ine , h@@ ar@@ mal@@ ine , mil@@ d@@ ly h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ og@@ en@@ ic --
to take the v@@ ine al@@ one is ra@@ ther to have sort of bl@@ ue h@@ az@@ y s@@ mo@@ ke d@@ ri@@ ft ac@@ ros@@ s your con@@ sci@@ ous@@ ness -- but it &apos;s mi@@ x@@ ed with the le@@ av@@ es of a sh@@ r@@ u@@ b in the co@@ ff@@ ee fam@@ ily called P@@ sy@@ ch@@ o@@ tr@@ ia vi@@ ri@@ d@@ is .
This pl@@ ant had in it some very pow@@ er@@ ful tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es , very cl@@ ose to brain ser@@ ot@@ on@@ in , di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine , 5@@ -@@ me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
If you &apos;ve ever se@@ en the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i bl@@ owing that s@@ nu@@ f@@ f up their n@@ os@@ es , that sub@@ st@@ ance they make from a different se@@ t of spec@@ ies also con@@ ta@@ ins me@@ th@@ o@@ x@@ y@@ di@@ me@@ th@@ y@@ l@@ tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine .
T@@ o have that pow@@ der bl@@ own up your n@@ ose is ra@@ ther like being sh@@ ot out of a ri@@ f@@ le bar@@ re@@ l lin@@ ed with bar@@ o@@ que pa@@ int@@ ings and l@@ and@@ ing on a se@@ a of el@@ ec@@ tr@@ ic@@ ity . It doesn &apos;t create the di@@ stor@@ tion of real@@ ity ; it cre@@ ates the dis@@ sol@@ ution of real@@ ity .
In fact , I used to ar@@ gu@@ e with my prof@@ ess@@ or , R@@ ich@@ ard E@@ v@@ an S@@ h@@ ult@@ es -- who is a man who s@@ par@@ ked the p@@ sy@@ ch@@ e@@ del@@ ic era with his disc@@ over@@ y of the mag@@ ic mus@@ h@@ ro@@ om@@ s in M@@ ex@@ ico in the 19@@ 3@@ 0@@ s --
I used to ar@@ gu@@ e that you c@@ ouldn &apos;t cl@@ as@@ si@@ f@@ y these tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es as h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ og@@ en@@ ic because by the time you &apos;re un@@ der the eff@@ ects there &apos;s no one h@@ ome any@@ more to experi@@ ence a h@@ all@@ uc@@ in@@ ation . But the thing about tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ in@@ es is they can@@ not be ta@@ k@@ en or@@ ally because they &apos;re d@@ en@@ at@@ u@@ red by an enz@@ y@@ me found natur@@ ally in the human g@@ ut called mon@@ o@@ am@@ ine o@@ x@@ id@@ ase .
They can only be ta@@ k@@ en or@@ ally if ta@@ k@@ en in con@@ j@@ un@@ c@@ tion with some other ch@@ em@@ ical that d@@ en@@ at@@ u@@ res the M@@ A@@ O .
Now , the f@@ as@@ cin@@ ating things are that the bet@@ a@@ -@@ car@@ b@@ ol@@ in@@ es found with@@ in that li@@ ana are M@@ A@@ O in@@ hi@@ b@@ it@@ ors of the pre@@ cis@@ e sort nec@@ ess@@ ary to pot@@ ent@@ i@@ ate the tr@@ y@@ p@@ t@@ am@@ ine . So you as@@ k y@@ our@@ self a question . How , in a fl@@ ora of 8@@ 0@@ ,000 spec@@ ies of v@@ as@@ c@@ ular pl@@ ant@@ s , do these people find these two mor@@ ph@@ olog@@ ically un@@ rel@@ ated pl@@ ant@@ s that when com@@ b@@ in@@ ed in this way , cre@@ ated a kind of bi@@ o@@ ch@@ em@@ ical ver@@ sion of the whole being gre@@ ater than the su@@ m of the part@@ s ?
Well , we use that great e@@ u@@ ph@@ em@@ ism , &quot; tri@@ al and er@@ r@@ or , &quot; which is ex@@ pos@@ ed to be me@@ an@@ ing@@ less .
But you as@@ k the In@@ di@@ ans , and they say , &quot; The pl@@ ant@@ s talk to us . &quot;
Well , what does that mean ?
This tri@@ be , the C@@ of@@ an , has 1@@ 7 v@@ ari@@ et@@ ies of ay@@ a@@ h@@ u@@ as@@ ca , all of which they dist@@ ing@@ u@@ is@@ h a great dist@@ ance in the for@@ est , all of which are re@@ fer@@ able to our e@@ y@@ e as one spec@@ ies .
And then you as@@ k them how they est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h their ta@@ x@@ on@@ om@@ y and they say , &quot; I thought you k@@ new something about pl@@ ant@@ s . I mean , don &apos;t you know any@@ thing ? &quot; And I said , &quot; No . &quot;
Well , it tur@@ ns out you take each of the 1@@ 7 v@@ ari@@ et@@ ies in the n@@ ight of a f@@ ul@@ l mo@@ on , and it s@@ ings to you in a different k@@ ey .
Now , that &apos;s not going to get you a P@@ h@@ .@@ D@@ . at H@@ ar@@ v@@ ard , but it &apos;s a lot more interest@@ ing than coun@@ t@@ ing st@@ am@@ en@@ s .
Now -- -- the problem -- the problem is that even those of us sy@@ m@@ pa@@ th@@ et@@ ic with the p@@ light of indi@@ gen@@ ous people vi@@ e@@ w them as qu@@ ain@@ t and col@@ or@@ ful but some@@ how re@@ d@@ uc@@ ed to the mar@@ g@@ ins of h@@ ist@@ ory as the real world , me@@ an@@ ing our world , mov@@ es on .
Well , the tr@@ ut@@ h is the 20@@ th cent@@ ur@@ y , 3@@ 00 years from now , is not going to be rem@@ em@@ ber@@ ed for its w@@ ars or its technolog@@ ical innov@@ ations , but ra@@ ther as the era in which we st@@ ood by and e@@ i@@ ther act@@ iv@@ ely end@@ or@@ s@@ ed or pass@@ iv@@ ely acc@@ ep@@ ted the m@@ ass@@ ive des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion of b@@ ot@@ h bi@@ olog@@ ical and cult@@ ur@@ al diver@@ s@@ ity on the plan@@ et . Now , the problem is@@ n &apos;t change .
Al@@ l cult@@ u@@ res through all time have con@@ st@@ ant@@ ly been eng@@ ag@@ ed in a d@@ ance with new possi@@ bil@@ ities of life .
And the problem is not technology it@@ self .
The S@@ i@@ ou@@ x In@@ di@@ ans did not st@@ op being S@@ i@@ ou@@ x when they g@@ ave up the b@@ ow and arr@@ ow any more than an Amer@@ ic@@ an st@@ op@@ p@@ ed being an Amer@@ ic@@ an when he g@@ ave up the h@@ or@@ se and bu@@ gg@@ y .
It &apos;s not change or technology that th@@ re@@ at@@ en@@ s the in@@ te@@ gr@@ ity of the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here . It is power ,
the cr@@ u@@ de face of dom@@ in@@ ation .
Wh@@ er@@ ever you look around the world , you disc@@ over that these are not cult@@ u@@ res d@@ est@@ in@@ ed to f@@ ade away ;
these are d@@ y@@ n@@ am@@ ic liv@@ ing pe@@ op@@ les being d@@ riv@@ en out of ex@@ ist@@ ence by id@@ ent@@ if@@ i@@ able for@@ ces that are be@@ y@@ on@@ d their capac@@ ity to ad@@ ap@@ t to :
wh@@ ether it &apos;s the eg@@ re@@ gi@@ ous de@@ for@@ est@@ ation in the h@@ om@@ el@@ and of the P@@ en@@ an --
a n@@ om@@ a@@ di@@ c people from S@@ ou@@ the@@ ast A@@ sia , from S@@ ar@@ aw@@ ak -- a people who liv@@ ed f@@ ree in the for@@ est un@@ t@@ il a gener@@ ation ago , and now have all been re@@ d@@ uc@@ ed to serv@@ itu@@ de and pros@@ tit@@ ution on the ban@@ ks of the riv@@ ers , where you can see the riv@@ er it@@ self is so@@ il@@ ed with the s@@ il@@ t that se@@ ems to be car@@ r@@ ying h@@ al@@ f of B@@ or@@ ne@@ o away to the S@@ ou@@ th Ch@@ ina S@@ ea , where the J@@ ap@@ an@@ ese fre@@ igh@@ ter@@ s h@@ an@@ g light in the h@@ or@@ iz@@ on
read@@ y to f@@ ill their h@@ ol@@ ds with ra@@ w l@@ og@@ s ri@@ p@@ p@@ ed from the for@@ est --
or , in the case of the Y@@ an@@ om@@ am@@ i , it &apos;s the di@@ se@@ ase ent@@ ities that have come in , in the w@@ a@@ ke of the disc@@ over@@ y of g@@ old .
O@@ r if we go into the m@@ oun@@ ta@@ ins of T@@ i@@ be@@ t , where I &apos;m doing a lot of res@@ ear@@ ch rec@@ ent@@ ly , you &apos;ll see it &apos;s a cr@@ u@@ de face of polit@@ ical dom@@ in@@ ation .
You know , gen@@ o@@ ci@@ de , the ph@@ y@@ s@@ ical ex@@ t@@ inc@@ tion of a people is univer@@ s@@ ally con@@ dem@@ ned , but e@@ th@@ no@@ ci@@ de , the des@@ tr@@ uc@@ tion of people &apos;s way of life , is not only not con@@ dem@@ ned , it &apos;s univer@@ s@@ ally , in many qu@@ ar@@ ter@@ s , c@@ el@@ e@@ br@@ ated as part of a develop@@ ment str@@ at@@ eg@@ y .
And you can@@ not understand the pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t un@@ t@@ il you m@@ ove through it at the gr@@ ound l@@ ev@@ el .
I on@@ ce tr@@ av@@ ell@@ ed 6@@ ,000 mil@@ es from Ch@@ eng@@ d@@ u in W@@ es@@ ter@@ n Ch@@ ina over@@ l@@ and through s@@ ou@@ the@@ ast@@ er@@ n T@@ i@@ be@@ t to L@@ h@@ as@@ a with a y@@ oun@@ g col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue , and it was only when I got to L@@ h@@ as@@ a that I underst@@ ood the face be@@ h@@ ind the stat@@ ist@@ ics you he@@ ar about :
6@@ ,000 s@@ ac@@ red mon@@ um@@ ents tor@@ n ap@@ art to d@@ ust and as@@ h@@ es ,
1@@ .@@ 2 million people k@@ ill@@ ed by the c@@ ad@@ res dur@@ ing the C@@ ult@@ ur@@ al R@@ evol@@ ution .
This y@@ oun@@ g man &apos;s fa@@ ther had been as@@ c@@ ri@@ b@@ ed to the P@@ an@@ ch@@ en L@@ am@@ a .
That me@@ ant he was inst@@ ant@@ ly k@@ ill@@ ed at the time of the Ch@@ in@@ ese inv@@ as@@ ion .
H@@ is un@@ c@@ le fl@@ ed with H@@ is H@@ ol@@ iness in the D@@ i@@ as@@ por@@ a that t@@ ook the people to N@@ ep@@ al .
H@@ is mo@@ ther was in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated for the cr@@ im@@ e of being we@@ al@@ th@@ y .
He was sm@@ ug@@ gl@@ ed into the j@@ a@@ il at the age of two to h@@ ide ben@@ e@@ at@@ h her sk@@ ir@@ t ta@@ il@@ s because she c@@ ouldn &apos;t be@@ ar to be with@@ out him .
The sist@@ er who had done that br@@ ave de@@ ed was put into an educ@@ ation cam@@ p .
O@@ ne day she in@@ ad@@ ver@@ t@@ ent@@ ly ste@@ p@@ p@@ ed on an ar@@ m@@ b@@ and of M@@ a@@ o , and for that trans@@ gr@@ ess@@ ion , she was giv@@ en s@@ even years of h@@ ard l@@ ab@@ or .
The pa@@ in of T@@ i@@ be@@ t can be im@@ possi@@ ble to be@@ ar , but the re@@ dem@@ p@@ t@@ ive spi@@ r@@ it of the people is something to be@@ h@@ old .
And in the end , then , it really com@@ es down to a ch@@ o@@ ice :
do we want to live in a mon@@ o@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ at@@ ic world of mon@@ ot@@ on@@ y or do we want to em@@ br@@ ace a pol@@ y@@ ch@@ r@@ om@@ at@@ ic world of diver@@ s@@ ity ?
M@@ arg@@ ar@@ et M@@ e@@ ad , the great an@@ thr@@ op@@ olog@@ ist , said , before she di@@ ed , that her gre@@ at@@ est fe@@ ar was that as we d@@ ri@@ f@@ ted t@@ ow@@ ar@@ ds this bl@@ and@@ ly am@@ or@@ ph@@ ous gener@@ ic world vi@@ e@@ w not only would we see the ent@@ ire ran@@ ge of the human imag@@ in@@ ation re@@ d@@ uc@@ ed to a more n@@ arr@@ ow mo@@ d@@ al@@ ity of thought , but that we would w@@ a@@ ke from a dre@@ am one day hav@@ ing for@@ g@@ ott@@ en there were even other possi@@ bil@@ ities .
And it &apos;s hum@@ bl@@ ing to rem@@ em@@ ber that our spec@@ ies has , per@@ hap@@ s , been around for &#91; 1@@ 5@@ 0@@ ,000 &#93; years .
The Ne@@ ol@@ i@@ th@@ ic R@@ evol@@ ution -- which g@@ ave us ag@@ ric@@ ult@@ ure , at which time we succ@@ um@@ b@@ ed to the c@@ ult of the se@@ ed ; the po@@ e@@ try of the sh@@ am@@ an was dis@@ pl@@ ac@@ ed by the pr@@ ose of the pr@@ i@@ es@@ th@@ ood ; we cre@@ ated hi@@ er@@ arch@@ y spec@@ i@@ al@@ iz@@ ation sur@@ pl@@ us -- is only 1@@ 0@@ ,000 years ago .
The mo@@ der@@ n ind@@ us@@ tri@@ al world as we know it is bar@@ ely 3@@ 00 years old .
Now , that sh@@ all@@ ow h@@ ist@@ ory doesn &apos;t su@@ gg@@ est to me that we have all the ans@@ w@@ ers for all of the ch@@ all@@ eng@@ es that will con@@ fron@@ t us in the en@@ su@@ ing m@@ ill@@ en@@ n@@ ia .
When these my@@ ri@@ ad cult@@ u@@ res of the world are as@@ ked the me@@ an@@ ing of being human , they respon@@ d with 1@@ 0@@ ,000 different v@@ o@@ ic@@ es .
And it &apos;s with@@ in that s@@ ong that we will all re@@ disc@@ over the possi@@ bil@@ ity of being what we are : a f@@ ul@@ ly con@@ sci@@ ous spec@@ ies , f@@ ul@@ ly aw@@ are of en@@ sur@@ ing that all pe@@ op@@ les and all g@@ ard@@ en@@ s find a way to fl@@ ou@@ ris@@ h . And there are great mom@@ ents of op@@ tim@@ ism .
This is a ph@@ otog@@ rap@@ h I t@@ ook at the nor@@ ther@@ n ti@@ p of B@@ aff@@ in I@@ sl@@ and when I went n@@ ar@@ wh@@ al h@@ un@@ t@@ ing with some In@@ u@@ it people , and this man , O@@ l@@ ay@@ u@@ k , t@@ old me a mar@@ vel@@ ous story of his gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an gover@@ n@@ ment has not always been kind to the In@@ u@@ it people , and dur@@ ing the 19@@ 5@@ 0@@ s , to est@@ ab@@ li@@ s@@ h our s@@ over@@ e@@ ig@@ n@@ ty , we for@@ c@@ ed them into sett@@ l@@ em@@ ents .
This old man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther re@@ f@@ used to go .
The fam@@ ily , f@@ ear@@ ful for his life , t@@ ook away all of his we@@ ap@@ ons , all of his to@@ ol@@ s .
Now , you m@@ ust understand that the In@@ u@@ it did not fe@@ ar the col@@ d ; they t@@ ook ad@@ v@@ ant@@ age of it .
The r@@ un@@ n@@ ers of their s@@ le@@ ds were or@@ ig@@ in@@ ally made of fis@@ h w@@ rap@@ p@@ ed in car@@ i@@ b@@ ou h@@ ide .
So , this man &apos;s gr@@ and@@ fa@@ ther was not in@@ tim@@ id@@ ated by the Ar@@ c@@ t@@ ic n@@ ight or the b@@ li@@ zz@@ ard that was bl@@ owing .
He sim@@ p@@ ly s@@ li@@ p@@ p@@ ed out@@ side , p@@ ul@@ l@@ ed down his se@@ al@@ sk@@ in tr@@ ous@@ ers and de@@ f@@ ec@@ ated into his h@@ and . And as the f@@ ec@@ es beg@@ an to fre@@ e@@ z@@ e , he sh@@ ap@@ ed it into the form of a bl@@ ade .
He put a s@@ pr@@ ay of sal@@ iva on the ed@@ ge of the sh@@ it k@@ n@@ if@@ e and as it fin@@ ally fr@@ o@@ z@@ e sol@@ id , he b@@ ut@@ ch@@ er@@ ed a do@@ g with it .
He sk@@ in@@ ned the do@@ g and im@@ prov@@ is@@ ed a h@@ ar@@ ness , t@@ ook the ri@@ b@@ c@@ age of the do@@ g and im@@ prov@@ is@@ ed a sl@@ ed , h@@ ar@@ ness@@ ed up an ad@@ j@@ ac@@ ent do@@ g , and dis@@ ap@@ pe@@ ar@@ ed over the ice fl@@ o@@ es , sh@@ it k@@ n@@ if@@ e in bel@@ t .
Talk about gett@@ ing by with no@@ thing . And this , in many ways -- -- is a sy@@ m@@ bo@@ l of the res@@ ili@@ ence of the In@@ u@@ it people and of all indi@@ gen@@ ous people around the world .
The C@@ an@@ a@@ di@@ an gover@@ n@@ ment in A@@ pr@@ il of 19@@ 9@@ 9 g@@ ave back to t@@ ot@@ al contr@@ ol of the In@@ u@@ it an ar@@ ea of l@@ and l@@ arg@@ er than C@@ al@@ i@@ for@@ n@@ ia and T@@ ex@@ as put together .
It &apos;s our new h@@ om@@ el@@ and . It &apos;s called N@@ un@@ av@@ ut .
It &apos;s an in@@ de@@ pen@@ d@@ ent ter@@ rit@@ ory . They contr@@ ol all min@@ er@@ al res@@ our@@ ces .
A@@ n am@@ az@@ ing example of how a nat@@ ion@@ -@@ state can se@@ e@@ k res@@ tit@@ ution with its people .
And fin@@ ally , in the end , I think it &apos;s pret@@ ty ob@@ vi@@ ous at le@@ ast to all of all us who &apos;ve tr@@ av@@ el@@ ed in these rem@@ ot@@ e re@@ ach@@ es of the plan@@ et , to real@@ ize that they &apos;re not rem@@ ot@@ e at all .
They &apos;re h@@ om@@ el@@ ands of som@@ eb@@ ody .
They re@@ pres@@ ent br@@ an@@ ch@@ es of the human imag@@ in@@ ation that go back to the d@@ aw@@ n of time . And for all of us , the dre@@ am@@ s of these children , like the dre@@ am@@ s of our own children , bec@@ ome part of the n@@ a@@ ked ge@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ y of h@@ ope .
So , what we &apos;re trying to do at the N@@ at@@ ional G@@ e@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ic , fin@@ ally , is , we believe that polit@@ ici@@ ans will never ac@@ comp@@ li@@ s@@ h any@@ thing .
We think that pol@@ em@@ ics --
-- we think that pol@@ em@@ ics are not per@@ su@@ as@@ ive , but we think that stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ing can change the world , and so we are prob@@ ably the b@@ est stor@@ y@@ t@@ ell@@ ing inst@@ it@@ ution in the world . We get 3@@ 5 million h@@ its on our w@@ eb@@ s@@ ite every mon@@ th .
1@@ 5@@ 6 nat@@ ions car@@ r@@ y our tel@@ ev@@ is@@ ion chan@@ nel .
O@@ u@@ r mag@@ az@@ in@@ es are re@@ ad by mil@@ li@@ ons .
And what we &apos;re doing is a ser@@ ies of j@@ our@@ ne@@ y@@ s to the e@@ th@@ n@@ os@@ p@@ here where we &apos;re going to take our au@@ di@@ ence to pl@@ ac@@ es of su@@ ch cult@@ ur@@ al w@@ on@@ der that they can@@ not help but come away d@@ azz@@ l@@ ed by what they have se@@ en , and h@@ op@@ ef@@ ul@@ ly , ther@@ e@@ fore , em@@ br@@ ace gr@@ ad@@ ually , one by one , the centr@@ al re@@ vel@@ ation of an@@ thr@@ op@@ olog@@ y : that this world des@@ er@@ ves to ex@@ ist in a diver@@ se way , that we can find a way to live in a tru@@ ly m@@ ult@@ ic@@ ult@@ ur@@ al , pl@@ ur@@ al@@ ist@@ ic world
where all of the w@@ is@@ d@@ om of all pe@@ op@@ les can contr@@ i@@ bu@@ te to our coll@@ ect@@ ive w@@ ell@@ -@@ being .
Thank you very much .
I &apos;m going to talk to you about some stu@@ f@@ f that &apos;s in this b@@ ook of m@@ ine that I h@@ ope will res@@ on@@ ate with other things you &apos;ve al@@ read@@ y hear@@ d , and I &apos;ll try to make some conn@@ ect@@ ions my@@ self , in case you mis@@ s@@ ed them .
But I want to start with what I call the &quot; off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma . &quot;
The off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma of what ?
The off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma of all W@@ es@@ ter@@ n ind@@ us@@ tri@@ al soci@@ et@@ ies . And the off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma r@@ un@@ s like this : if we are interest@@ ed in ma@@ x@@ im@@ iz@@ ing the w@@ el@@ fare of our cit@@ iz@@ en@@ s , the way to do that is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize individu@@ al fre@@ ed@@ om .
The reas@@ on for this is b@@ ot@@ h that fre@@ ed@@ om is in and of it@@ self good , val@@ u@@ able , wor@@ th@@ wh@@ ile , ess@@ ent@@ ial to being human .
And because if people have fre@@ ed@@ om , then each of us can act on our own to do the things that will ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize our w@@ el@@ fare , and no one has to deci@@ de on our be@@ h@@ al@@ f .
The way to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize fre@@ ed@@ om is to ma@@ x@@ im@@ ize ch@@ o@@ ice .
The more ch@@ o@@ ice people have , the more fre@@ ed@@ om they have , and the more fre@@ ed@@ om they have , the more w@@ el@@ fare they have .
This , I think , is so de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ b@@ ed@@ ded in the water sup@@ p@@ ly that it w@@ ouldn &apos;t occu@@ r to any@@ one to question it .
And it &apos;s also de@@ ep@@ ly em@@ b@@ ed@@ ded in our li@@ ves .
I &apos;ll give you some exam@@ pl@@ es of what mo@@ der@@ n prog@@ res@@ s has made possi@@ ble for us .
This is my super@@ mark@@ et . N@@ ot su@@ ch a big one .
I want to say just a wor@@ d about sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ing .
1@@ 7@@ 5 sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings in my super@@ mark@@ et , if you don &apos;t coun@@ t the 10 ex@@ tra@@ -@@ vir@@ g@@ in ol@@ ive o@@ il@@ s and 1@@ 2 b@@ al@@ s@@ am@@ ic v@@ in@@ eg@@ ars you could bu@@ y to make a very l@@ ar@@ ge num@@ ber of your own sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings , in the off@@ -@@ chan@@ ce that n@@ one of the 1@@ 7@@ 5 the st@@ ore has on off@@ er su@@ it you .
So this is what the super@@ mark@@ et is like .
And then you go to the con@@ sum@@ er el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics st@@ ore to se@@ t up a st@@ er@@ e@@ o system -- spe@@ ak@@ ers , C@@ D pl@@ ay@@ er , t@@ ap@@ e pl@@ ay@@ er , t@@ un@@ er , amp@@ lif@@ i@@ er --
and in this one sing@@ le con@@ sum@@ er el@@ ec@@ tr@@ on@@ ics st@@ ore , there are that many st@@ er@@ e@@ o sy@@ st@@ ems .
We can con@@ str@@ uc@@ t si@@ x@@ -@@ and@@ -@@ a@@ -@@ h@@ al@@ f@@ -@@ million different st@@ er@@ e@@ o sy@@ st@@ ems out of the comp@@ on@@ ents that are on off@@ er in one st@@ ore .
You &apos;ve got to ad@@ m@@ it that &apos;s a lot of ch@@ o@@ ice .
In other dom@@ ain@@ s -- the world of commun@@ ic@@ ations .
There was a time , when I was a bo@@ y , when you could get any kind of tel@@ e@@ ph@@ one serv@@ ice you wanted , as long as it came from M@@ a B@@ ell .
You r@@ ent@@ ed your ph@@ one . You didn &apos;t bu@@ y it .
O@@ ne con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of that , by the way , is that the ph@@ one never br@@ o@@ ke .
And those d@@ ays are g@@ one .
We now have an al@@ most un@@ lim@@ ited v@@ ari@@ et@@ y of ph@@ ones , es@@ p@@ ec@@ i@@ ally in the world of c@@ ell ph@@ ones .
Th@@ ese are c@@ ell ph@@ ones of the fut@@ ure .
M@@ y f@@ av@@ or@@ ite is the m@@ id@@ d@@ le one -- the M@@ P@@ 3 pl@@ ay@@ er , n@@ ose h@@ air tr@@ im@@ m@@ er , and cr@@ è@@ me br@@ û@@ l@@ é@@ e tor@@ ch .
And if by some chan@@ ce you hav@@ en &apos;t se@@ en that in your st@@ ore y@@ et , you can res@@ t as@@ su@@ red that one day so@@ on , you will .
And what this does is it lead@@ s people to w@@ alk into their stor@@ es as@@ king this question . And do you know what the ans@@ w@@ er to this question now is ? The ans@@ w@@ er is &quot; no . &quot;
It is not possi@@ ble to bu@@ y a c@@ ell ph@@ one that doesn &apos;t do too much .
So , in other asp@@ ects of life that are much more sign@@ ific@@ ant than bu@@ ying things , the same expl@@ os@@ ion of ch@@ o@@ ice is tru@@ e .
H@@ e@@ al@@ th care . It is no l@@ ong@@ er the case in the Un@@ ited St@@ ates that you go to the d@@ oc@@ t@@ or , and the d@@ oc@@ t@@ or t@@ ell@@ s you what to do .
In@@ ste@@ ad , you go to the d@@ oc@@ t@@ or , and the d@@ oc@@ t@@ or t@@ ell@@ s you , &quot; Well , we could do A , or we could do B@@ . A has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . B has these ben@@ ef@@ its , and these ris@@ ks . What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; D@@ o@@ c , what should I do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c s@@ ays , &quot; A has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks , and B has these ben@@ ef@@ its and ris@@ ks .
What do you want to do ? &quot;
And you say , &quot; If you were me , D@@ o@@ c , what would you do ? &quot;
And the do@@ c s@@ ays , &quot; But I &apos;m not you . &quot;
And the res@@ ult is -- we call it &quot; pat@@ i@@ ent aut@@ on@@ om@@ y , &quot; which ma@@ kes it s@@ ound like a good thing ,
but it really is a sh@@ if@@ t@@ ing of the b@@ ur@@ de@@ n and the respon@@ si@@ bil@@ ity for decis@@ ion@@ -@@ ma@@ king from som@@ eb@@ ody who know@@ s something -- n@@ am@@ ely , the d@@ oc@@ t@@ or -- to som@@ eb@@ ody who know@@ s no@@ thing and is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly sic@@ k and th@@ us not in the b@@ est sh@@ ap@@ e to be ma@@ king decis@@ ions -- n@@ am@@ ely , the pat@@ i@@ ent .
There &apos;s en@@ or@@ m@@ ous mark@@ et@@ ing of pres@@ c@@ ri@@ p@@ tion dr@@ ug@@ s to people like you and me , which , if you think about it , ma@@ kes no sen@@ se at all , sin@@ ce we can &apos;t bu@@ y them .
Wh@@ y do they mark@@ et to us if we can &apos;t bu@@ y them ?
The ans@@ w@@ er is that they ex@@ p@@ ect us to call our d@@ oc@@ t@@ ors the next mor@@ ning and as@@ k for our pres@@ c@@ ri@@ p@@ t@@ ions to be chang@@ ed .
S@@ om@@ e@@ thing as dr@@ am@@ at@@ ic as our id@@ ent@@ ity has now bec@@ ome a m@@ att@@ er of ch@@ o@@ ice , as this s@@ li@@ de is me@@ ant to in@@ dic@@ ate . We don &apos;t in@@ h@@ er@@ it an id@@ ent@@ ity ; we get to inv@@ ent it .
And we get to re@@ -@@ inv@@ ent our@@ selves as of@@ t@@ en as we like .
And that me@@ ans that every day , when you w@@ a@@ ke up in the mor@@ ning , you have to deci@@ de what kind of pers@@ on you want to be .
W@@ it@@ h res@@ p@@ ect to mar@@ ri@@ age and fam@@ ily , there was a time when the de@@ fa@@ ult as@@ sum@@ p@@ tion that al@@ most every@@ one had is that you got mar@@ ri@@ ed as so@@ on as you could , and then you started hav@@ ing k@@ ids as so@@ on as you could .
The only real ch@@ o@@ ice was who , not when , and not what you did after .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays , every@@ thing is very much up for gr@@ ab@@ s .
I te@@ ach w@@ on@@ der@@ f@@ ul@@ ly int@@ el@@ lig@@ ent stud@@ ents , and I as@@ si@@ g@@ n 20 percent less work than I used to .
And it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less s@@ mar@@ t , and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re less di@@ lig@@ ent .
It &apos;s because they are pre@@ occu@@ pi@@ ed , as@@ king th@@ em@@ selves , &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed or not ? S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed now ?
S@@ h@@ ould I get mar@@ ri@@ ed l@@ ater ? S@@ h@@ ould I have k@@ ids first , or a car@@ e@@ er first ? &quot;
Al@@ l of these are con@@ sum@@ ing quest@@ ions .
And they &apos;re going to ans@@ w@@ er these quest@@ ions , wh@@ ether or not it me@@ ans not doing all the work I as@@ si@@ g@@ n and not gett@@ ing a good gr@@ ade in my cour@@ s@@ es .
And in@@ de@@ ed they should . Th@@ ese are important quest@@ ions to ans@@ w@@ er .
W@@ or@@ k -- we are bl@@ ess@@ ed , as C@@ ar@@ l was po@@ int@@ ing out , with the technology that en@@ ab@@ les us to work every min@@ ute of every day from any place on the plan@@ et -- ex@@ ce@@ pt the R@@ and@@ ol@@ p@@ h H@@ ot@@ el .
There is one cor@@ ner , by the way , that I &apos;m not going to tell any@@ body about , where the W@@ i@@ F@@ i actually wor@@ ks .
I &apos;m not t@@ ell@@ ing you about it because I want to use it .
So what this me@@ ans , this incredi@@ ble fre@@ ed@@ om of ch@@ o@@ ice we have with res@@ p@@ ect to work , is that we have to make a decis@@ ion , again and again and again , about wh@@ ether we should or sh@@ ouldn &apos;t be working .
We can go to w@@ at@@ ch our k@@ id pl@@ ay s@@ oc@@ c@@ er , and we have our c@@ ell ph@@ one on one hi@@ p , and our B@@ l@@ ack@@ ber@@ r@@ y on our other hi@@ p , and our l@@ ap@@ to@@ p , pres@@ um@@ ably , on our l@@ ap@@ s .
And even if they &apos;re all sh@@ ut off , every min@@ ute that we &apos;re w@@ at@@ ch@@ ing our k@@ id m@@ ut@@ il@@ ate a s@@ oc@@ c@@ er g@@ ame , we are also as@@ king our@@ selves , &quot; S@@ h@@ ould I ans@@ w@@ er this c@@ ell ph@@ one call ?
S@@ h@@ ould I respon@@ d to this em@@ a@@ il ? S@@ h@@ ould I d@@ ra@@ ft this l@@ etter ? &quot;
And even if the ans@@ w@@ er to the question is &quot; no , &quot; it &apos;s cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly going to make the experi@@ ence of your k@@ id &apos;s s@@ oc@@ c@@ er g@@ ame very different than it would &apos;ve been .
So every@@ where we look , big things and sm@@ all things , materi@@ al things and lif@@ est@@ y@@ le things , life is a m@@ att@@ er of ch@@ o@@ ice .
And the world we used to live in loo@@ ked like this . &#91; Well , actually , they are wr@@ itt@@ en in st@@ one . &#93; That is to say , there were some ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es , but not every@@ thing was a m@@ att@@ er of ch@@ o@@ ice .
And the world we now live in loo@@ ks like this . &#91; The T@@ en C@@ om@@ m@@ and@@ m@@ ents D@@ Y@@ I K@@ it &#93; And the question is , is this good ne@@ w@@ s , or b@@ ad ne@@ w@@ s ?
And the ans@@ w@@ er is , &quot; y@@ es . &quot;
We all know what &apos;s good about it , so I &apos;m going to talk about what &apos;s b@@ ad about it .
Al@@ l of this ch@@ o@@ ice has two eff@@ ects , two ne@@ g@@ ative eff@@ ects on people .
O@@ ne eff@@ ect , par@@ ad@@ o@@ x@@ ically , is that it produc@@ es par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , ra@@ ther than li@@ ber@@ ation .
W@@ it@@ h so many op@@ t@@ ions to ch@@ o@@ ose from , people find it very diffic@@ ult to ch@@ o@@ ose at all .
I &apos;ll give you one very dr@@ am@@ at@@ ic example of this : a stud@@ y that was done of inv@@ est@@ m@@ ents in vol@@ un@@ t@@ ary re@@ ti@@ re@@ ment pl@@ ans .
A col@@ le@@ ag@@ ue of m@@ ine got acc@@ ess to inv@@ est@@ ment re@@ cor@@ ds from V@@ an@@ gu@@ ard , the g@@ ig@@ ant@@ ic m@@ ut@@ u@@ al@@ -@@ fun@@ d comp@@ any of about a million em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es and about 2@@ ,000 different wor@@ k@@ pl@@ ac@@ es .
And what she found is that for every 10 m@@ ut@@ u@@ al fun@@ ds the em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ er off@@ er@@ ed , r@@ ate of part@@ ici@@ p@@ ation went down two percent .
You off@@ er 50 fun@@ ds -- 10 percent fe@@ w@@ er em@@ pl@@ o@@ ye@@ es part@@ ici@@ p@@ ate than if you only off@@ er f@@ ive . Wh@@ y ?
Because with 50 fun@@ ds to ch@@ o@@ ose from , it &apos;s so dam@@ n h@@ ard to deci@@ de which fun@@ d to ch@@ o@@ ose , that you &apos;ll just put it off un@@ t@@ il t@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ow .
And then t@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ow , and t@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ow , and t@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ow , and of course t@@ om@@ or@@ r@@ ow never com@@ es .
Un@@ der@@ st@@ and that not only does this mean that people are going to have to e@@ at do@@ g f@@ ood when they ret@@ ire because they don &apos;t have en@@ ough money put away , it also me@@ ans that ma@@ king the decis@@ ion is so h@@ ard that they p@@ ass up sign@@ ific@@ ant mat@@ ch@@ ing money from the em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ er .
B@@ y not part@@ ici@@ pat@@ ing , they are pass@@ ing up as much as 5@@ ,000 doll@@ ars a year from the em@@ pl@@ o@@ y@@ er , who would happ@@ ily mat@@ ch their contr@@ i@@ b@@ ution .
So par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is is a con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of hav@@ ing too many ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es .
And I think it ma@@ kes the world look like this .
&#91; And l@@ ast@@ ly , for all et@@ er@@ n@@ ity , F@@ ren@@ ch , b@@ le@@ u ch@@ e@@ ese , or ran@@ ch ? &#93;
You really want to get the decis@@ ion right if it &apos;s for all et@@ er@@ n@@ ity , right ?
You don &apos;t want to pic@@ k the wr@@ ong m@@ ut@@ u@@ al fun@@ d , or the wr@@ ong sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ing .
So that &apos;s one eff@@ ect . The secon@@ d eff@@ ect is that even if we man@@ age to over@@ come the par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is and make a ch@@ o@@ ice , we end up less s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with the res@@ ult of the ch@@ o@@ ice than we would be if we had fe@@ w@@ er op@@ t@@ ions to ch@@ o@@ ose from .
And there are s@@ ever@@ al reas@@ ons for this .
O@@ ne of them is that with a lot of different sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ings to ch@@ o@@ ose from , if you bu@@ y one , and it &apos;s not per@@ f@@ ect -- and what sal@@ ad dr@@ ess@@ ing is ? -- it &apos;s e@@ as@@ y to imag@@ ine you could have made a different ch@@ o@@ ice that would have been better . And what happen@@ s is this imag@@ in@@ ed al@@ ter@@ nat@@ ive ind@@ uc@@ es you to re@@ gre@@ t the decis@@ ion you made , and this re@@ gre@@ t sub@@ tr@@ act@@ s from the s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ act@@ ion you get out of the decis@@ ion you made ,
even if it was a good decis@@ ion .
The more op@@ t@@ ions there are , the e@@ as@@ i@@ er it is to re@@ gre@@ t any@@ thing at all that is dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ing about the op@@ tion that you ch@@ ose .
S@@ econ@@ d , what econom@@ ists call &quot; opport@@ un@@ ity cos@@ ts . &quot;
D@@ an G@@ il@@ ber@@ t made a big point this mor@@ ning of tal@@ king about how much the way in which we val@@ ue things de@@ pen@@ ds on what we comp@@ are them to .
Well , when there are l@@ ots of al@@ ter@@ nat@@ iv@@ es to consi@@ der , it is e@@ as@@ y to imag@@ ine the attr@@ act@@ ive fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of al@@ ter@@ nat@@ iv@@ es that you re@@ ject that make you less s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed with the al@@ ter@@ nat@@ ive that you &apos;ve ch@@ os@@ en .
H@@ ere &apos;s an example . &#91; I can &apos;t st@@ op thinking about those other av@@ a@@ il@@ able par@@ king sp@@ ac@@ es on W 8@@ 5@@ th str@@ e@@ et &#93; S@@ or@@ r@@ y if you &apos;re not New Y@@ or@@ k@@ ers .
H@@ ere &apos;s what you &apos;re sup@@ pos@@ ed to be thinking .
H@@ ere &apos;s this c@@ ou@@ ple on the H@@ amp@@ t@@ ons .
V@@ er@@ y ex@@ pens@@ ive real est@@ ate .
G@@ org@@ e@@ ous be@@ ach . Be@@ aut@@ if@@ u@@ l day . They have it all to th@@ em@@ selves .
What could be better ? &quot; Well , dam@@ n it , &quot; this gu@@ y is thinking ,
&quot; It &apos;s A@@ ug@@ ust . E@@ ver@@ y@@ body in my M@@ an@@ h@@ att@@ an ne@@ igh@@ bor@@ h@@ ood is away .
I could be par@@ king right in fron@@ t of my buil@@ ding . &quot;
And he sp@@ end@@ s two we@@ e@@ ks n@@ agg@@ ed by the idea that he is mis@@ s@@ ing the opport@@ un@@ ity , day after day , to have a great par@@ king sp@@ ace .
O@@ p@@ port@@ un@@ ity cos@@ ts sub@@ tr@@ act from the s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ act@@ ion we get out of what we ch@@ o@@ ose , even when what we ch@@ o@@ ose is ter@@ ri@@ f@@ ic .
And the more op@@ t@@ ions there are to consi@@ der , the more attr@@ act@@ ive fe@@ at@@ u@@ res of these op@@ t@@ ions are going to be re@@ fl@@ ected by us as opport@@ un@@ ity cos@@ ts .
H@@ ere &apos;s another example .
Now this c@@ art@@ o@@ on ma@@ kes a lot of po@@ int@@ s .
It ma@@ kes po@@ int@@ s about liv@@ ing in the mom@@ ent as well , and prob@@ ably about doing things sl@@ ow@@ ly .
But one point it ma@@ kes is that wh@@ en@@ ever you &apos;re ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing one thing , you &apos;re ch@@ o@@ os@@ ing not to do other things
that may have l@@ ots of attr@@ act@@ ive fe@@ at@@ u@@ res , and it &apos;s going to make what you &apos;re doing less attr@@ act@@ ive .
Th@@ ir@@ d : es@@ cal@@ ation of ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations .
This h@@ it me when I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans .
I we@@ ar j@@ e@@ ans al@@ most all the time .
There was a time when j@@ e@@ ans came in one f@@ lav@@ or , and you b@@ ought them , and they f@@ it like c@@ ra@@ p , they were incredi@@ b@@ ly un@@ com@@ fort@@ able , if you w@@ ore them and w@@ as@@ h@@ ed them en@@ ough tim@@ es , they started to feel O@@ K .
I went to re@@ place my j@@ e@@ ans after years of w@@ ear@@ ing these old ones , and I said , &quot; I want a p@@ air of j@@ e@@ ans . H@@ ere &apos;s my si@@ z@@ e . &quot;
And the sh@@ op@@ ke@@ e@@ per said , &quot; D@@ o you want s@@ li@@ m f@@ it , e@@ as@@ y f@@ it , rel@@ a@@ x@@ ed f@@ it ?
You want b@@ utt@@ on f@@ ly or z@@ i@@ p@@ per f@@ ly ? You want st@@ on@@ e@@ w@@ as@@ h@@ ed or ac@@ id@@ -@@ w@@ as@@ h@@ ed ?
D@@ o you want them distr@@ ess@@ ed ?
You want b@@ oo@@ t c@@ ut , t@@ ap@@ er@@ ed , bl@@ ah bl@@ ah . &quot; O@@ n and on he went .
M@@ y j@@ a@@ w dr@@ op@@ p@@ ed . And after I rec@@ over@@ ed , I said , &quot; I want the kind that used to be the only kind . &quot; He had no idea what that was , so I sp@@ ent an h@@ our trying on all these dam@@ n j@@ e@@ ans , and I w@@ al@@ ked out of the st@@ ore -- tr@@ ut@@ h ! -- with the b@@ est@@ -@@ f@@ itt@@ ing j@@ e@@ ans I had ever had .
I did better . Al@@ l this ch@@ o@@ ice made it possi@@ ble for me to do better .
But -- I fel@@ t wor@@ se .
Wh@@ y ? I wr@@ ot@@ e a whole b@@ ook to try to expl@@ ain this to my@@ self .
The reas@@ on -- The reas@@ on I fel@@ t wor@@ se is that , with all of these op@@ t@@ ions av@@ a@@ il@@ able , my ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations about how good a p@@ air of j@@ e@@ ans should be went up .
I had very l@@ ow , no partic@@ ular ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations when they only came in one f@@ lav@@ or . When they came in 100 f@@ lav@@ ors , dam@@ n it , one of them should &apos;ve been per@@ f@@ ect .
And what I got was good , but it w@@ as@@ n &apos;t per@@ f@@ ect .
And so I com@@ par@@ ed what I got to what I ex@@ p@@ ected , and what I got was dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ing in com@@ par@@ is@@ on to what I ex@@ p@@ ected .
A@@ d@@ ding op@@ t@@ ions to people &apos;s li@@ ves can &apos;t help but incre@@ ase the ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations people have about how good those op@@ t@@ ions will be .
And what that &apos;s going to pro@@ du@@ ce is less s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ act@@ ion with res@@ ult@@ s , even when they &apos;re good res@@ ult@@ s .
N@@ ob@@ ody in the world of mark@@ et@@ ing know@@ s this .
&#91; It all loo@@ ks so great . I can &apos;t w@@ a@@ it to be dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ed . &#93; Because if they did , you w@@ ouldn &apos;t all know what this was about .
The tr@@ ut@@ h is more like this .
&#91; E@@ ver@@ y@@ thing was better back when every@@ thing was wor@@ se &#93; The reas@@ on that every@@ thing was better back when every@@ thing was wor@@ se is that when every@@ thing was wor@@ se , it was actually possi@@ ble for people to have experi@@ en@@ ces that were a p@@ le@@ as@@ ant sur@@ pr@@ ise .
N@@ ow@@ ad@@ ays , the world we live in -- we aff@@ lu@@ ent , ind@@ us@@ tri@@ al@@ ized cit@@ iz@@ en@@ s , with per@@ f@@ ect@@ ion the ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ation -- the b@@ est you can ever h@@ ope for is that stu@@ f@@ f is as good as you ex@@ p@@ ect it to be .
You will never be p@@ le@@ as@@ ant@@ ly sur@@ pr@@ is@@ ed because your ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations , my ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations , have g@@ one through the ro@@ of .
The sec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ iness -- this is what you all came for -- the sec@@ re@@ t to happ@@ iness is l@@ ow ex@@ p@@ ect@@ ations . I want to say --
just a little aut@@ o@@ bi@@ og@@ rap@@ h@@ ical mom@@ ent -- that I actually am mar@@ ri@@ ed to a w@@ if@@ e , and she &apos;s really qu@@ ite w@@ on@@ der@@ ful .
I c@@ ouldn &apos;t have done better .
I didn &apos;t sett@@ le . But sett@@ l@@ ing is@@ n &apos;t always su@@ ch a b@@ ad thing .
F@@ in@@ ally -- O@@ ne con@@ se@@ qu@@ ence of bu@@ ying a b@@ ad@@ -@@ f@@ itt@@ ing p@@ air of j@@ e@@ ans when there is only one kind to bu@@ y is that when you are dis@@ s@@ at@@ is@@ fi@@ ed , and you as@@ k why ,
who &apos;s respon@@ si@@ ble , the ans@@ w@@ er is c@@ le@@ ar : the world is respon@@ si@@ ble .
What could you do ?
When there are h@@ un@@ dre@@ ds of different st@@ y@@ les of j@@ e@@ ans av@@ a@@ il@@ able , and you bu@@ y one that is dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ing , and you as@@ k why , who &apos;s respon@@ si@@ ble ? It is equ@@ ally c@@ le@@ ar that the ans@@ w@@ er to the question is &quot; you . &quot;
You could have done better .
W@@ it@@ h a h@@ un@@ dre@@ d different k@@ in@@ ds of j@@ e@@ ans on dis@@ pl@@ ay , there is no ex@@ c@@ use for fa@@ il@@ ure .
And so when people make decis@@ ions , and even th@@ ough the res@@ ult@@ s of the decis@@ ions are good , they feel dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ed about them ; they bl@@ ame th@@ em@@ selves .
C@@ lin@@ ical de@@ press@@ ion has expl@@ o@@ ded in the ind@@ us@@ tri@@ al world in the last gener@@ ation .
I believe a sign@@ ific@@ ant -- not the only , but a sign@@ ific@@ ant -- contr@@ i@@ b@@ ut@@ or to this expl@@ os@@ ion of de@@ press@@ ion , and also su@@ ic@@ ide , is that people have experi@@ en@@ ces that are dis@@ ap@@ po@@ int@@ ing because their st@@ and@@ ar@@ ds are so h@@ ig@@ h ,
and then when they have to expl@@ ain these experi@@ en@@ ces to th@@ em@@ selves , they think they &apos;re at fa@@ ult .
And so the net res@@ ult is that we do better in gener@@ al , ob@@ j@@ ect@@ iv@@ ely , and we feel wor@@ se .
So let me re@@ min@@ d you .
This is the off@@ ici@@ al d@@ og@@ ma , the one that we all take to be tru@@ e , and it &apos;s all f@@ al@@ se . It is not tru@@ e .
There &apos;s no question that some ch@@ o@@ ice is better than n@@ one , but it doesn &apos;t f@@ oll@@ ow from that that more ch@@ o@@ ice is better than some ch@@ o@@ ice .
There &apos;s some mag@@ ical am@@ oun@@ t . I don &apos;t know what it is .
I &apos;m pret@@ ty con@@ f@@ id@@ ent that we have long sin@@ ce pass@@ ed the point where op@@ t@@ ions im@@ pr@@ ove our w@@ el@@ fare .
Now , as a pol@@ ic@@ y m@@ att@@ er -- I &apos;m al@@ most done -- as a pol@@ ic@@ y m@@ att@@ er , the thing to think about is this :
what en@@ ab@@ les all of this ch@@ o@@ ice in ind@@ us@@ tri@@ al soci@@ et@@ ies is materi@@ al aff@@ lu@@ ence .
There are l@@ ots of pl@@ ac@@ es in the world , and we have hear@@ d about s@@ ever@@ al of them , where their problem is not that they have too much ch@@ o@@ ice .
Th@@ e@@ ir problem is that they have too little .
So the stu@@ f@@ f I &apos;m tal@@ king about is the p@@ ec@@ u@@ li@@ ar problem of mo@@ der@@ n , aff@@ lu@@ ent , W@@ es@@ ter@@ n soci@@ et@@ ies .
And what is so fr@@ ustr@@ ating and in@@ f@@ ur@@ i@@ ating is this : St@@ eve L@@ ev@@ it@@ t tal@@ ked to you y@@ es@@ ter@@ day about how these ex@@ pens@@ ive and diffic@@ ult@@ -@@ to@@ -@@ inst@@ all chil@@ d se@@ at@@ s don &apos;t help .
What I &apos;m t@@ ell@@ ing you is that these ex@@ pens@@ ive , compl@@ ic@@ ated ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es -- it &apos;s not sim@@ p@@ ly that they don &apos;t help .
They actually h@@ ur@@ t .
They actually make us wor@@ se off .
If some of what en@@ ab@@ les people in our soci@@ et@@ ies to make all of the ch@@ o@@ ic@@ es we make were sh@@ if@@ ted to soci@@ et@@ ies in which people have too few op@@ t@@ ions , not only would those people &apos;s li@@ ves be im@@ prov@@ ed , but our@@ s would be im@@ prov@@ ed also ,
which is what econom@@ ists call a &quot; P@@ ar@@ et@@ o@@ -@@ im@@ prov@@ ing m@@ ove . &quot;
In@@ come re@@ distr@@ i@@ b@@ ution will make every@@ one better off -- not just po@@ or people -- because of how all this ex@@ c@@ ess ch@@ o@@ ice pl@@ ag@@ u@@ es us .
So to con@@ cl@@ u@@ de . &#91; You can be any@@ thing you want to be -- no lim@@ its &#93;
You &apos;re sup@@ pos@@ ed to re@@ ad this c@@ art@@ o@@ on , and , being a s@@ op@@ h@@ ist@@ ic@@ ated pers@@ on , say , &quot; A@@ h ! What does this fis@@ h know ?
You know , no@@ thing is possi@@ ble in this fis@@ h@@ b@@ ow@@ l . &quot;
I@@ m@@ p@@ over@@ is@@ h@@ ed imag@@ in@@ ation , a my@@ o@@ pi@@ c vi@@ e@@ w of the world --
and that &apos;s the way I re@@ ad it at first .
The more I thought about it , h@@ ow@@ ever , the more I came to the vi@@ e@@ w that this fis@@ h know@@ s something .
Because the tr@@ ut@@ h of the m@@ att@@ er is that if you sh@@ att@@ er the fis@@ h@@ b@@ ow@@ l so that every@@ thing is possi@@ ble , you don &apos;t have fre@@ ed@@ om . You have par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is .
If you sh@@ att@@ er this fis@@ h@@ b@@ ow@@ l so that every@@ thing is possi@@ ble , you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ act@@ ion .
You incre@@ ase par@@ al@@ y@@ s@@ is , and you de@@ cre@@ ase s@@ at@@ is@@ f@@ act@@ ion .
E@@ ver@@ y@@ body ne@@ ed@@ s a fis@@ h@@ b@@ ow@@ l .
This one is al@@ most cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly too lim@@ ited -- per@@ hap@@ s even for the fis@@ h , cer@@ ta@@ in@@ ly for us .
But the ab@@ s@@ ence of some met@@ ap@@ h@@ or@@ ical fis@@ h@@ b@@ ow@@ l is a re@@ ci@@ p@@ e for mis@@ er@@ y , and , I s@@ us@@ p@@ ect , dis@@ ast@@ er .
Thank you very much .
